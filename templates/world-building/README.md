## 🎯 Overview

World-building is the art of creating believable settings that enhance your story. These templates help you develop rich, consistent worlds—whether you're crafting an epic fantasy realm, a distant sci-fi planet, or a contemporary city with hidden depths.

## 💡 World-Building Best Practices

### Do ✅

| Practice | Why It Matters |
|----------|----------------|
| Start with story needs | Prevents irrelevant tangents |
| Create consistent rules | Builds reader trust |
| Leave room for discovery | Writing reveals new needs |
| Use sensory details | Makes world tangible |
| Consider consequences | Deepens authenticity |
| Build contradictions | Reflects real-world complexity |

### Avoid ❌

| Pitfall | The Problem |
|---------|-------------|
| Info-dumping | Stops story dead |
| Inconsistent rules | Breaks reader trust |
| Over-building before drafting | Wastes time, stifles discovery |
| Generic fantasy/sci-fi elements | Feels derivative |
| World without conflict | No story fuel |
| Ignoring practical realities | Breaks immersion |

## 🔗 Integration with Story

### World-Building Serves Story

Your world should:
- **Create obstacles** for characters to overcome
- **Provide resources** characters need (or lack)
- **Generate conflict** through competing interests
- **Enable character growth** through challenges
- **Reinforce themes** through its nature

### Questions to Ask

For every world-building detail:
1. Does this serve the story?
2. Will this appear on the page?
3. Does this create interesting complications?
4. Does this contradict anything established?
5. Does this feel authentic to this world?

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How much world-building should I do before writing?</strong></summary>

Enough to start confidently, but not so much you never start. A good rule: develop what you need for your first act, plus a rough sketch of the rest. Let discovery during drafting guide further development.

**Minimum before drafting:**
- Key locations for opening scenes
- Basic rules of any speculative elements
- Protagonist's immediate environment
- Main sources of conflict

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>My world-building keeps growing. How do I stop?</strong></summary>

Ask these questions:
1. Does my story need this detail?
2. Am I avoiding actually writing?
3. Can I develop this later if needed?

Set a deadline for "enough" world-building and start drafting. You can always return to development when the story reveals gaps.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I convey world-building without info-dumping?</strong></summary>

- **Through character interaction** — Let characters demonstrate how the world works
- **Through conflict** — World rules create obstacles
- **Through sensory detail** — Show, don't explain
- **Through implication** — Let readers infer from context
- **In motion** — Reveal during action, not in static explanation

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Do I need to create languages, calendars, etc.?</strong></summary>

Only if they serve your story. Tolkien created languages because linguistics was his passion—it made Middle-earth deeper. But many excellent fantasy novels use minimal constructed language. Focus energy on what matters for *your* story.
