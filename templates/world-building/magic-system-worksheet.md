# ✨ Magic System Worksheet

> *A structured approach to creating consistent, compelling magic (or technology)*

---

## 🎯 Overview

Whether you're designing magic, advanced technology, superpowers, or any speculative system, this worksheet helps you create rules that are consistent, have meaningful costs, and serve your story. The key principle: **limitations create drama**.

**Time Investment:** 1-3 hours  
**Best For:** Fantasy, science fiction, superhero, paranormal fiction  
**Core Principle:** Sanderson's First Law — "The reader's ability to solve conflict satisfactorily with magic is directly proportional to how well the reader understands said magic."

## 🔮 Part 1: Foundation

### 1.1 System Type

**What are you designing?**
- [ ] Magic (supernatural, mystical)
- [ ] Psionics (mental powers)
- [ ] Technology (advanced science)
- [ ] Superpowers (extraordinary abilities)
- [ ] Divine/Spiritual powers
- [ ] Hybrid system
- [ ] Other: _____________

**System Name:** ________________________

### 1.2 Hardness Scale

How well-defined are your rules?

```
SOFT MAGIC ←————————————————————————→ HARD MAGIC
(Mysterious,       (Balanced)        (Systematic,
 wondrous)                           predictable)
    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10
                      
Your System: [ ]
```

**Soft Magic** (1-3): Mysterious, rarely explained, creates wonder
- Example: Gandalf's magic in *Lord of the Rings*
- Best for: Atmosphere, wonder, threat

**Hard Magic** (7-10): Clear rules, defined limits, logical system
- Example: Allomancy in *Mistborn*
- Best for: Problem-solving, clever protagonists

**Middle Ground** (4-6): Some rules clear, some mystery remains
- Example: Magic in *Harry Potter*
- Best for: Flexibility with some consistency

**Why This Matters:**
- Soft magic should NOT solve major problems (feels like cheating)
- Hard magic CAN solve problems (reader understands and accepts)
- Match your hardness to how you'll use magic in plot

## 💡 Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Problem | Solution |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Unlimited power** | No tension | Add meaningful costs and limits |
| **Inconsistent rules** | Reader distrust | Track and verify every use |
| **Magic solves everything** | No stakes | Ensure problems need more than magic |
| **Costs disappear** | Feels cheap | Show costs consistently |
| **Overly complex** | Confusing | Simplify or reveal gradually |
| **No impact on world** | Feels fake | Think through societal effects |
| **Power creep** | Escalation spiral | Stick to established limits |
