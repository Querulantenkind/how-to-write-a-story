# 🎬 Scene Planning Templates

> *Practical, ready-to-use templates for designing strong individual scenes*

---

## 📖 **What This Folder Is For**

Scene templates help you plan **one scene at a time** so each scene earns its place:

- Something changes (externally, internally, or both)
- Tension and cause/effect stay clear
- The scene links cleanly to what comes next

Use these in **planning**, **drafting**, or **revision**. Skip anything that doesn’t serve your process.

---

## 🧩 **Templates Included**

### **1) 🧱 Scene Outline Template**

**File:** `scene-outline-template.md`

- A flexible “one scene on one page” structure
- Works for action, dialogue, introspection, or mixed scenes

➡️ Start here if you need clarity quickly.

---

### **2) 🎯 Scene Goal Worksheet**

**File:** `scene-goal-worksheet.md`

- Defines the POV character’s goal, the obstacle, and the cost
- Forces a decision or outcome (even if it’s a partial win)

➡️ Use when a scene feels *aimless*.

---

### **3) ⚡ Conflict & Tension Checklist**

**File:** `conflict-tension-checklist.md`

- A fast diagnostic checklist for making a scene sharper
- Covers stakes, escalation, subtext, and turning points

➡️ Use during revision.

---

### **4) 🔗 Scene Sequence Planner**

**File:** `scene-sequence-planner.md`

- Plans 3–10 scenes as a chain of cause and effect
- Helps balance pace, reveals, and emotional movement

➡️ Use when you know the *chapter* goal but not the *scene order*.

---

## ✅ **Quick Start (5 Minutes)**

1. Pick a POV character.
2. Fill out **Goal / Obstacle / Stakes** in the worksheet.
3. Draft a quick version using the **Scene Outline**.
4. Run the result through the **Conflict & Tension Checklist**.

---

## 📝 **Printing / Copy-Paste Tip**

All templates are designed for copy/paste into your notes app, writing software, or a new document. Duplicate a template file and rename it per scene (e.g., `scene-12-the-confrontation.md`).
