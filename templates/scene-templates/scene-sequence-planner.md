## 📈 Pacing & Variety Check

- **Which scene is the biggest escalation?**
- **Where is the “breather” (if needed)?**
- **Do any two adjacent scenes do the same job?** If yes, merge or cut.

## 🔍 Reveal Planning (Optional)

- **What does the reader learn in this sequence?**
- **What does the POV learn?**
- **What remains unknown to keep momentum?**
