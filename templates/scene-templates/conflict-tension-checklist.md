# ⚡ Conflict & Tension Checklist (Scene Revision)

> *A quick pass to sharpen a scene without rewriting from scratch*

---

## ✅ Core Clarity

- [ ] I can state the POV character’s **immediate goal** in one sentence.
- [ ] I can name the **main obstacle/opposition**.
- [ ] The scene has a **clear outcome** (win/loss/compromise/reversal).
- [ ] Something **changes** by the end (situation, knowledge, relationship, decision).

---

## 🔥 Stakes & Urgency

- [ ] The scene shows **what it costs** to fail.
- [ ] The scene implies or states **why now** (time pressure, opportunity window, emotional breaking point).
- [ ] Stakes are **specific** (not just “it’s important”).

---

## 📈 Escalation

- [ ] Tension **rises** at least once (new complication, tighter constraint, worse choice).
- [ ] The POV’s **tactics change** when the first attempt doesn’t work.
- [ ] The obstacle **pushes back** (actively or through consequences).

---

## 🧨 Turning Point

- [ ] There is a moment where the scene **can’t return** to the old status quo.
- [ ] The turning point is **caused** (a choice, action, reveal), not random.

---

## 🗣️ Dialogue & Subtext (If Dialogue Exists)

- [ ] Each character wants something in the conversation.
- [ ] At least one line has **subtext** (said vs meant).
- [ ] The dialogue isn’t repeating what the reader already knows.
- [ ] The power dynamic is clear (who is winning/losing moment to moment).

---

## 🧠 Emotion & Interior Movement

- [ ] The POV’s emotions **shift** in response to events.
- [ ] The scene includes at least one **decision**, even a small one.
- [ ] The internal response is **shown through behavior** (not only explanation).

---

## 🧱 Scene Mechanics

- [ ] The opening establishes **where/when/who** quickly.
- [ ] The middle contains **pressure** (conflict, complication, resistance).
- [ ] The ending creates **forward motion** (new goal, new problem, new question).

---

## 🔗 Cause & Effect

- [ ] This scene happens **because** of the previous one.
- [ ] The next scene follows **therefore** (a consequence, not a coincidence).

---

## 🛠️ If the Scene Still Feels Flat

Pick one targeted fix:
- Increase the **cost** of failure.
- Add a **constraint** (time, limited options, social risk).
- Introduce a **complication** halfway through.
- Force a **choice** with trade-offs.
- Make the opposition’s goal **stronger and clearer**.
