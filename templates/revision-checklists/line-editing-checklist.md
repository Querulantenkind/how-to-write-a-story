# ✨ Line Editing Checklist

> *Transform adequate prose into compelling writing, sentence by sentence*

---

## 🎯 Overview

Line editing focuses on the craft of writing at the sentence and paragraph level. This is where you refine voice, strengthen word choices, and make your prose sing. Only begin line editing after structural revisions are complete.

**When to Use:** After developmental and scene-level edits are done  
**Time Required:** 2-4 weeks for a full manuscript  
**Goal:** Polish prose while preserving your unique voice

> **Warning:** Line editing too early wastes time on passages you might cut. Complete structural edits first!

---

## 📋 Pre-Line Editing Setup

### Before You Begin

- [ ] Structural/developmental edits complete
- [ ] Scene-level revisions done
- [ ] No major rewrites remaining
- [ ] Manuscript backed up
- [ ] Style sheet created (your conventions and choices)

### Recommended Approach

**Option A: Chapter by Chapter**
- Work through manuscript sequentially
- Apply all checks to each chapter before moving on
- Best for: Maintaining narrative flow

**Option B: Issue by Issue**
- Do one type of check through entire manuscript
- Example: Remove all filter words first, then check all dialogue
- Best for: Training your eye to spot specific issues

## 🔍 Part 1: Eliminating Weak Writing

### 1.1 Filter Words

Filter words distance readers from the experience by telling them the character is perceiving rather than showing the perception.

**Common Filter Words:**
| Cut/Revise | Example (Weak → Strong) |
|------------|-------------------------|
| saw | She saw the door open → The door swung open |
| heard | He heard footsteps → Footsteps echoed |
| felt | I felt cold → Cold seeped into my bones |
| noticed | She noticed his hands shaking → His hands trembled |
| watched | He watched her leave → She walked away |
| realized | I realized it was over → It was over |
| knew | She knew he was lying → He was lying |
| thought | He thought about leaving → Should he leave? |
| seemed | It seemed dark → Darkness filled the room |
| wondered | She wondered why → Why had he done it? |

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for: saw, heard, felt, noticed, watched, realized, knew, wondered, thought, seemed
- [ ] Evaluate each instance — some are legitimate
- [ ] Revise to put reader directly in the experience

---

### 1.2 Weak Verbs

Replace weak verb + adverb with strong verb. Replace weak verb + adjective with precise description.

**"To Be" Verbs (was, were, is, are, been):**
- Often indicate passive voice or telling
- Search and evaluate each instance
- Keep when: State of being is the point
- Revise when: Action would be stronger

**Examples:**
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| She was running quickly | She sprinted / She raced |
| He was angry | His jaw clenched / He slammed the door |
| The sky was very blue | Azure sky stretched overhead |
| She was a good leader | She rallied her team / inspired loyalty |

**"Had" and Helping Verbs:**
- Necessary for past perfect tense
- Often overused in flashbacks
- Use minimally then shift to simple past

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for: was, were, had, could, would, should
- [ ] Evaluate each — many are fine, but look for patterns
- [ ] Convert passive to active where appropriate
- [ ] Replace weak verb + adverb with strong verb

---

### 1.3 Adverbs

Not all adverbs are bad, but many are crutches for weak verbs.

**Adverbs to Question:**
- -ly adverbs modifying dialogue tags (she said quietly)
- Intensifiers (very, really, extremely, totally)
- Adverbs that duplicate the verb (whispered quietly)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for: -ly words, very, really, extremely, quite, rather
- [ ] Ask: Does the verb need this support?
- [ ] Ask: Can a stronger verb replace both?
- [ ] Keep adverbs that add genuinely new meaning

**Examples:**
| Cut or Revise | Keep |
|---------------|------|
| "Stop!" she shouted loudly | "Stop!" she shouted |
| He walked slowly | He shuffled / ambled |
| She was very tired | She was exhausted |
| He smiled happily | He grinned |
| He deliberately misunderstood | ✓ (adds meaning) |
| She laughed nervously | ✓ (specifies type) |

---

### 1.4 Redundancies

**Common Redundant Phrases:**
| Redundant | Concise |
|-----------|---------|
| past history | history / past |
| stood up | stood |
| sat down | sat |
| nodded his head | nodded |
| shrugged her shoulders | shrugged |
| circled around | circled |
| completely destroyed | destroyed |
| brief moment | moment |
| small in size | small |
| red in color | red |
| true fact | fact |
| end result | result |
| free gift | gift |
| advance planning | planning |

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for: up (stood up, rose up), down (sat down, kneeled down)
- [ ] Check for head, shoulders, feet after body verbs
- [ ] Search for: completely, totally, entirely + strong words
- [ ] Remove words that repeat what's already clear

---

### 1.5 Crutch Words

Every writer has words they overuse. Identify yours.

**Common Crutch Words:**
- just, that, then, suddenly, finally
- started to, began to, proceeded to
- in order to (often just "to")
- the fact that (often cuttable)
- basically, actually, literally

**Finding Your Crutches:**
1. Use word frequency counter tool
2. Note repeated words while reading aloud
3. Ask beta readers what they noticed

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Run word frequency analysis
- [ ] Search for: just, that, then, suddenly, finally, very, really
- [ ] Evaluate each instance — many "that"s are unnecessary
- [ ] Remove or vary as needed

---

## 🎭 Part 2: Showing vs. Telling

### 2.1 Emotion Telling

**Telling Pattern:** [Character] felt/was [emotion word]

**Common Emotion Tells:**
| Telling | Showing Options |
|---------|-----------------|
| She was angry | Her hands clenched. Heat rose in her chest. |
| He was nervous | He fidgeted with his watch. His voice cracked. |
| She felt happy | She couldn't stop smiling. She bounced on her toes. |
| He was scared | His heart raced. He backed toward the door. |
| She felt sad | Tears blurred her vision. She couldn't look at him. |

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for: felt, was, emotion words (angry, sad, happy, scared, etc.)
- [ ] For each: Can I show this through action, body language, or thought?
- [ ] Keep some telling — not every emotion needs a paragraph
- [ ] Show important emotional moments; tell minor ones

---

### 2.2 Character Description Telling

**Telling Pattern:** [Character] was [personality trait]

| Telling | Showing |
|---------|---------|
| He was generous | He pressed his last twenty into her hand |
| She was shy | She ducked her head, letting her hair fall like a curtain |
| He was arrogant | "I doubt anyone else could have managed it" |
| She was intelligent | She solved the puzzle before anyone else opened the box |

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for: was/were + personality adjectives
- [ ] Demonstrate traits through action and dialogue
- [ ] Let readers draw their own conclusions

---

### 2.3 Narrative Summary

Some summary is necessary, but key moments deserve scene.

**Signs of Over-Summarizing:**
- Long passages without dialogue
- Telling what characters discussed rather than showing it
- Glossing over emotional climaxes
- "They talked for hours about..."

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Identify summaries of important conversations — should these be scenes?
- [ ] Find emotional moments told in summary — dramatize key ones
- [ ] Check that big reveals happen "on screen"
- [ ] Balance: Use summary for transitions, scene for important moments

---

## 🗣️ Part 3: Dialogue Polish

### 3.1 Dialogue Tags

**Principle:** "Said" is invisible. Other tags draw attention.

**Tags to Use:**
- said (99% of the time)
- asked (for questions)

**Tags to Use Sparingly:**
- whispered, shouted, muttered (when truly needed)
- replied, answered, responded (often unnecessary)

**Tags to Avoid:**
- hissed (unless literally hissing)
- growled, spat, breathed, laughed (as tags — can't "laugh" words)
- adverb + said ("said angrily")

**Better than Tags:**
Action beats that show who's speaking and add characterization

**Examples:**
| Weak | Strong |
|------|--------|
| "I hate you," she said angrily | "I hate you." She slammed the door |
| "I don't know," he replied hesitantly | "I don't know." He wouldn't meet her eyes |
| "This is amazing," she exclaimed | "This is amazing." She ran her fingers over the sculpture |

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Search for said + adverb → replace with action beat or cut adverb
- [ ] Search for creative tags → replace with said or action beat
- [ ] Ensure every line of dialogue has clear attribution
- [ ] Remove tags when speaker is obvious from context

---

### 3.2 Dialogue Content

**Each line of dialogue should:**
- Sound like that specific character
- Serve a purpose (reveal character, advance plot, create tension)
- Not be "on the nose" — people often speak around what they mean

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Read all dialogue aloud — does it sound natural?
- [ ] Cover character names — can you tell who's speaking by voice alone?
- [ ] Check for "As you know, Bob" information dumps
- [ ] Look for subtext opportunities — what's unsaid?
- [ ] Cut small talk that doesn't characterize or advance

---

### 3.3 Dialogue Rhythm

**Vary dialogue patterns:**
- Line lengths (short and punchy vs. longer speeches)
- Tag placement (beginning, middle, end, absent)
- Action beats vs. tags
- Direct dialogue vs. reported speech

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Vary line lengths within conversations
- [ ] Don't always put tags in same position
- [ ] Break up long speeches with action or reaction
- [ ] Check for ping-pong effect (too perfectly alternating)

---

## 📝 Part 4: Prose Style

### 4.1 Sentence Variety

**Check for:**
- Similar sentence lengths back-to-back
- Same sentence structure repeated (Subject-verb-object, subject-verb-object)
- Same opening word repeated
- Lack of rhythm

**Sentence Length Guidelines:**
- Mix long, flowing sentences with short punches
- Short sentences = Impact, speed, tension
- Long sentences = Reflection, description, complexity
- Action scenes: Shorter sentences
- Emotional moments: Vary for rhythm

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Read several paragraphs aloud — is there rhythm?
- [ ] Identify passages with same-length sentences → vary them
- [ ] Check for repeated sentence openings (He..., She..., I...)
- [ ] Use short sentences for impact
- [ ] Use longer sentences to slow pace or convey complexity

---

### 4.2 Paragraph Structure

**Each paragraph should:**
- Focus on one idea or moment
- Flow logically from previous paragraph
- Vary in length

**Dialogue paragraph rules:**
- New speaker = New paragraph
- Action by speaker stays in their paragraph
- Reaction by other character = New paragraph

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Check for overly long paragraphs (break up if needed)
- [ ] Check for strings of single-sentence paragraphs (combine if needed)
- [ ] Verify dialogue paragraphing is correct
- [ ] Ensure paragraph breaks at natural turning points

---

### 4.3 Word Choice

**Principles:**
- Specific beats general (German shepherd vs. dog)
- Familiar beats obscure (use vs. utilize)
- Short beats long when meaning is same (use vs. utilize)
- Sound matters (consider how words sound together)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Replace general words with specific ones where it matters
- [ ] Remove jargon unless character would use it
- [ ] Check for accidentally repeated words in close proximity
- [ ] Listen for awkward sound combinations (alliteration, rhyme)
- [ ] Ensure word choices fit the tone and character POV

---

### 4.4 Metaphors & Similes

**Check each for:**
- Originality (avoid clichés)
- Accuracy (do they actually work?)
- Appropriateness (would this character think this way?)
- Necessity (does the comparison add value?)

**Clichés to Avoid:**
- dead as a doornail
- quiet as a mouse
- blind as a bat
- heart of gold
- cold as ice
- light as a feather

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Flag all metaphors and similes
- [ ] Cut clichés or make them fresh
- [ ] Ensure comparisons are in POV character's frame of reference
- [ ] Remove mixed metaphors
- [ ] Cut comparisons that don't earn their space

---

## 🎨 Part 5: Voice & POV

### 5.1 Narrative Voice Consistency

**Check for:**
- Consistent tone throughout
- Vocabulary appropriate to POV character
- Observations only POV character would make
- No head-hopping (seeing into other characters' minds)

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Narrative voice matches character's education, background, personality
- [ ] Descriptions filtered through POV character's perspective
- [ ] No "camera" descriptions that float outside character
- [ ] Internal thoughts consistent with character's voice

---

### 5.2 POV Discipline

**First Person:**
- [ ] No information protagonist couldn't know
- [ ] No describing protagonist's own face in detail (without mirror cliché)
- [ ] Consistent use of "I" (no accidental "you" or "we" shifts)

**Third Limited:**
- [ ] Stick to one character's head per scene
- [ ] Don't reveal other characters' private thoughts
- [ ] Filter everything through POV character's perception
- [ ] POV character present in every scene

**Third Omniscient:**
- [ ] Narrator voice is distinct and consistent
- [ ] Transitions between character perspectives are smooth
- [ ] Omniscient observations add value

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Verify POV type is consistent
- [ ] Check for POV slips (head-hopping)
- [ ] Ensure information flow is plausible
- [ ] Confirm sensory details match POV character's awareness
