# 📝 First Draft Checklist

> *Big-picture assessment for your newly completed manuscript*

---

## 🎯 Overview

Congratulations on finishing your first draft! This checklist helps you evaluate your manuscript's structural foundation before diving into detailed revision. Focus on story-level elements, not prose quality.

**When to Use:** After completing your first draft and a rest period (2-4 weeks recommended)  
**Time Required:** 3-5 focused sessions  
**Goal:** Identify major structural issues that need addressing

> **Remember:** Your first draft is supposed to be imperfect. This checklist helps you see clearly what needs work — that's a feature, not a bug.
