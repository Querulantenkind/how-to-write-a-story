## 🔄 Pass 1: Structural/Developmental Edit

> **Focus:** Story architecture, plot, and pacing  
> **Time:** 1-2 weeks  
> **Read Speed:** Fast — focus on story flow, not sentences

### 1.1 Overall Story Assessment

#### Beginning (First 25%)
- [ ] **Hook effectiveness** — Does the opening grab attention?
- [ ] **Protagonist introduction** — Do we meet and connect with the main character?

- [ ] **World grounding** — Is the setting clear without info-dumping?
- [ ] **Inciting incident** — Does something disrupt the status quo?
- [ ] **Story question posed** — Is the central question clear to readers?

#### Middle (50%)
- [ ] **Rising tension** — Does conflict escalate progressively?
- [ ] **Midpoint shift** — Is there a significant turn at the halfway point?
- [ ] **Character agency** — Is the protagonist actively driving events?
- [ ] **Subplot integration** — Do subplots enhance the main story?
- [ ] **Pacing variety** — Are there peaks and valleys of intensity?
- [ ] **Information revelation** — Is important information revealed effectively?

#### Ending (Final 25%)
- [ ] **Crisis/Dark moment** — Does the protagonist face their greatest challenge?
- [ ] **Climax satisfaction** — Is the final confrontation earned and impactful?
- [ ] **Resolution completeness** — Are major plot threads resolved?
- [ ] **Emotional payoff** — Does the ending deliver on the story's promise?

### 1.2 Plot Logic Check

#### Cause and Effect
- [ ] Every major event has adequate setup
- [ ] Character decisions lead logically to consequences
- [ ] No convenient coincidences solve major problems
- [ ] Foreshadowing plants pay off

#### Plot Holes & Inconsistencies

**Plot Hole Tracker:**
| Issue | Location | Severity | Solution |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| | | | |
| | | | |

### 1.3 Pacing Analysis

#### Scene Mapping
Create a visual map of your scenes:

```
Chapter 1: [Tension Level 1-10: 6] [Purpose: Setup/Hook]
Chapter 2: [Tension Level 1-10: 4] [Purpose: Character development]
Chapter 3: [Tension Level 1-10: 7] [Purpose: First complication]
...
```

**Pacing Issues to Check:**
- [ ] No long stretches without tension or conflict
- [ ] Action scenes balanced with reflection scenes
- [ ] Story doesn't sag in the middle
- [ ] Pace accelerates toward climax
- [ ] Opening isn't bogged down with backstory

### 1.4 Structural Revision Actions

Based on your analysis:

## 💡 Revision Tips & Troubleshooting

### When You're Stuck

**Problem:** Can't see the forest for the trees
- Take a complete break (minimum 1 week)
- Write a one-page summary of your story from memory
- Compare what you remember to what's on the page

**Problem:** Every sentence feels wrong
- You may be over-editing — step back to bigger picture
- Read published books in your genre to recalibrate
- Focus on one specific issue per pass

**Problem:** Not sure what to cut
- If you're not sure, mark it and move on
- Ask: "If I cut this, what would the reader miss?"
- Trust your beta readers to confirm or deny

**Problem:** Revisions making it worse
- Compare to earlier draft — you may be over-editing
- Identify what's actually wrong vs. what you're tired of
- Get outside perspective

### Signs You're Done

✅ Changes are getting smaller and smaller  
✅ You're making things different, not better  
✅ Beta readers have no major concerns  
✅ You feel confident sharing it  
✅ You're excited about what's next (not just exhausted)
