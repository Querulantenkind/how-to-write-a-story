### Why This Order Matters

> ⚠️ **Critical Principle:** Always work from big picture to small details.

**The Problem with Skipping Ahead:**
- You might spend hours perfecting a paragraph you'll later cut
- Structural changes ripple through the entire manuscript
- You'll miss forest-level issues while examining trees

## 💡 Revision Best Practices

### 🧠 Mindset

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| ✅ Approach with curiosity | ❌ Approach with dread |
| ✅ See revision as discovery | ❌ See revision as punishment |
| ✅ Be willing to cut beloved passages | ❌ Cling to every word |
| ✅ Trust the process | ❌ Expect perfection in one pass |
| ✅ Take breaks when frustrated | ❌ Force through burnout |

### ⚡ Efficiency Tips

1. **Color-Code Your Passes**
   - Use different highlight colors for different issues
   - Example: Yellow = weak verbs, Blue = telling, Pink = cut candidate

2. **Create a "Cuts" Document**
   - Save deleted passages in a separate file
   - Reduces fear of cutting
   - Some cuts may work elsewhere

3. **Read Aloud**
   - Catches awkward phrasing
   - Reveals dialogue issues
   - Helps with rhythm and flow

4. **Change the Format**
   - Print it out
   - Change font/size
   - Read on a different device
   - Fresh perspective reveals hidden issues

5. **One Focus Per Pass**
   - Don't try to fix everything at once
   - Systematic passes are more effective
   - Reduces overwhelm

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><strong>How many revision passes do I need?</strong></summary>

There's no fixed number. Some writers do 3-5 passes, others do 20+. The key is doing passes until you're making the story better, not just different. When you find yourself changing things back to earlier versions, you're probably done (or need outside feedback).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Should I use beta readers before or after line editing?</strong></summary>

**After structural revision, before line editing.** Beta readers catch big-picture issues you're too close to see. Get their feedback before spending time polishing prose that might get cut.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How do I know when I'm done revising?</strong></summary>

You're ready to move on when:
- You've addressed known structural issues
- Beta readers aren't finding major problems
- You're confident in the story you're telling
- Changes are getting smaller and smaller
- You feel excited (not terrified) to share it

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What if I hate my manuscript during revision?</strong></summary>

This is completely normal! The "I hate everything I've written" phase often hits during revision. Push through with systematic work. Don't make major decisions (like abandoning the project) while in this phase. Take breaks, get feedback, and trust the process.
