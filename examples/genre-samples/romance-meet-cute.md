# 💌 Romance Meet-Cute (Original)

The elevator doors opened on the seventh floor like a stage curtain, and I walked straight into my own humiliation.

A man stood in the hallway holding a sheet cake the size of a coffee table.

The cake was tilting.

I saw it all at once: the sagging corner, the frosting sliding with slow inevitability, the tiny plastic bride and groom leaning as if they’d had enough.

“Don’t,” he said.

I hadn’t moved.

“Don’t what?”

“Don’t offer to help,” he said, adjusting his grip in a way that proved he had already lost the battle and was now negotiating terms. “If you offer, I’ll say yes. If I say yes, I’ll drop it. If I drop it, I’ll cry. I’m not emotionally equipped for public crying today.”

I blinked. “That’s a lot of future for a hallway.”

“It’s a fragile cake,” he said. “It inspires prophecy.”

The frosting slid another millimeter.

“I’m still going to help,” I said.

He made a noise that might have been gratitude or surrender. “Okay. But you have to follow directions. This cake has already seen things.”

“I’m excellent with directions.”

“That’s what everyone says before they’re wrong.”

I stepped closer, hands out, and caught the edge of the box just as the cardboard bowed.

Our fingers touched—brief, accidental—and I hated that my body noticed.

“Who is this for?” I asked, because questions are safer than feelings.

“My sister,” he said. “Her wedding.”

“Your sister’s wedding is happening in this building?”

“In Apartment 7C. Which is a sentence that will make sense in exactly five minutes and not a second sooner.”

We shuffled sideways like conspirators.

“Are you always this dramatic?” I asked.

He looked at me, quick and surprised, like he hadn’t expected the hallway to contain an audience.

“Only when I’m terrified,” he said.

Something softened in my chest, inconvenient and immediate.

“Good,” I said. “Because I’m about to tell you the truth.”

He raised an eyebrow.

“I live in 7C,” I said.

The cake stopped sliding, as if even gravity needed a moment.

He exhaled. “Okay,” he said slowly. “So you’re either my salvation or the person I’m about to disappoint forever.”

“Let’s aim for salvation,” I said.

He smiled—small, crooked, real.

“Lead the way,” he said. “Prophet.”
