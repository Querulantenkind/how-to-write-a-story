# 🕵️ Mystery Cold Open (Original)

The note was folded into a perfect triangle, the kind you make when you want to feel precise.

It waited on my desk between the stapler and the mug I never washed, as if it had always belonged there.

I should say I don’t get anonymous notes. Not anymore. Not since the last case taught me that anonymity is just confidence wearing a cheap mask.

The paper was unlined. The ink was black. The handwriting was printed—careful, slow, like someone copying a style they’d practiced.

**YOU MISCOUNTED.**

That was it.

No signature. No threat. No demand.

Just the accusation.

I reached for my calendar, because calendars are where people hide the truth: in plain sight, in boxes.

Three months ago, the city’s water plant had lost power for exactly seven minutes. The official report blamed a storm that never arrived. I had counted the technicians on duty. I had counted the locked doors. I had counted the steps from the breaker room to the control panel.

Seven minutes was too long.

But what did you do with *too long* when no one else wanted to admit time had stretched?

I turned the note over. Nothing.

My phone buzzed. A text from an unknown number:

**Start with the clocks.**

I looked up.

Above the reception desk, the lobby clock ticked toward nine.

Behind it, half hidden by a fern, was another clock.

The second hand on the second clock moved in the opposite direction.
