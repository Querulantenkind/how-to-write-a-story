# 🚀 Sci‑Fi Idea Hook (Original)

I didn’t steal the memory because I wanted to.

I stole it because my mother’s laugh had started to stutter.

The clinic called it “degradation,” like she was a file format going obsolete. They offered subscription upgrades and polite condolences. They offered everything except what I needed: a way to keep her whole.

So I went to the market under the bridge where you could buy old songs, forgotten languages, and the taste of strawberries from before the drought.

The vendor’s eyes were filmed over with a cheap visor that projected pricing into his pupils.

“What are you after?” he asked.

“A laugh,” I said.

He smiled like that was the saddest kind of request. “Those are expensive. People don’t part with them.”

“I don’t need someone else’s,” I said. “I need hers back.”

That got his attention.

He led me behind the stalls to a booth where the air hummed softly, like a refrigerator. A chair sat in the middle, cables draped over it like vines.

“You’re not licensed,” I said.

“No,” he agreed. “So you’ll have to decide how brave you are.”

I thought of my mother standing in the kitchen, forgetting the punchline to her favorite joke and smiling anyway as if confusion were charming.

“How much?” I asked.

He named a number I couldn’t pay.

So I did what people do when they have no leverage.

I made a promise.

“I’ll bring you a memory no one’s ever sold,” I said.

He laughed. “That’s not a thing.”

“It is,” I said. “The first time the city’s weather system lied.”

His smile disappeared.

“That’s classified,” he whispered.

“Everything important is,” I said.

The booth’s hum deepened, eager.

“Sit,” he said.

And that’s how I learned the market’s first rule:

You don’t trade memories.

You trade consequences.
