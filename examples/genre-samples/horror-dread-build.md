# 🕯️ Horror Dread Build (Original)

The house smelled like wet pennies.

No one else mentioned it.

My aunt had always kept her place too clean, too bright, as if dust were an insult. But now the curtains were half-drawn in the middle of the afternoon, and the light that slipped through looked tired.

“Tea?” she asked.

Her voice was normal. Her hands were steady. The kettle whistled with the cheerful insistence of a lie.

I followed her into the kitchen because that’s what you do with family. You follow them into the rooms that still feel familiar.

On the counter sat three cups.

“We’re only two,” I said.

She didn’t look at the cups. “He gets cold,” she said.

My mouth went dry. “Who?”

The kettle’s whistle climbed higher, as if it wanted out.

My aunt poured anyway. The third cup filled last, and the tea in it was darker, almost black.

“Did you repaint?” I asked, pointing at the wall by the pantry.

The paint there was new—too new—covering a rectangle as tall as a person.

My aunt’s smile tightened. “No,” she said. “I covered it.”

The floorboard beneath my foot creaked, and the sound went on for too long. A creak doesn’t echo. A creak doesn’t trail off like a sigh.

I set my cup down without drinking.

My aunt placed the third cup at the far end of the table.

Then she sat.

Then she waited.

A minute passed.

The air in the kitchen thickened, metallic and close.

The surface of the tea in the third cup rippled.

Not from footsteps.

From something leaning near it.

My aunt didn’t look up.

“Don’t stare,” she whispered, and the fear in her voice made the room colder than any ghost story.

“I didn’t,” I lied.

The chair at the far end of the table scraped back.

There was no one in it.

The scrape was slow, deliberate—like manners.
