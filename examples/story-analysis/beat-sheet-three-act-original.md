# 🎬 Three-Act Beat Sheet (Original Example)

This is a worked example using an **original premise**.

## Premise

A junior archivist discovers her city’s disaster sirens are scheduled to sound tomorrow for a catastrophe that the public doesn’t know is coming.

## Act 1 — Setup

- **Opening image:** The archive basement: orderly boxes, silent alarms, a job that rewards obedience.
- **Theme question:** Is it safer to obey procedures or to tell the truth early?
- **Inciting incident:** She finds a sealed bulletin labeled *SIREN TEST: DO NOT ANNOUNCE* with tomorrow’s date.
- **Refusal / hesitation:** She assumes it’s a drill; her supervisor warns her not to “invent emergencies.”
- **First turning point (commitment):** She steals the bulletin and calls her estranged brother (a paramedic) anyway.

## Act 2 — Confrontation

- **Fun & games (promise of premise):** She digs through older bulletins and sees a pattern: public “tests” precede real collapses.
- **Rising complications:** Records are missing; her access is revoked; someone searches her apartment.
- **Midpoint (reversal):** The brother confirms extra ambulance staffing orders went out citywide.
- **Bad guys close in:** The supervisor frames her for a data breach; police show up at the archive.
- **All is lost:** She’s arrested; the bulletin is confiscated; the siren time is hours away.

## Act 3 — Resolution

- **Dark night / insight:** In a holding cell, she realizes procedure exists to protect institutions, not people.
- **Climax:** She uses a payphone to call a radio station and gives verifiable details that force an on-air warning.
- **Resolution:** The city hears the warning; some evacuate. Consequences land: her job is gone, but the truth is out.
- **Closing image:** The archive basement again—this time with a new box: *WHISTLEBLOWER CASE FILE*.
