# 📖 Examples

> Practical, reusable examples: templates, breakdowns, and short original samples.

---

## 📚 Overview

The goal of this folder is to help you **see craft principles in action** and then apply them to your own work.

To keep the repository easy to share and legally safe, the examples here:
- Use **original writing** for sample text
- Focus on **analysis frameworks** you can apply to any story
- Avoid reproducing **copyrighted excerpts**

---

## 🧭 What’s Inside

- **[Story analysis](story-analysis/)** — analysis templates + a complete worked example (original)
- **[Plot structures](plot-structures/)** — beat sheets + outlines (original premises)
- **[Opening lines](opening-lines/)** — hook patterns + practice sets (original)
- **[Genre samples](genre-samples/)** — short scenes showing conventions (original)
- **[Character examples](character-examples/)** — arcs, motivations, voice (original)

## 🎨 How to Use These Examples

<details>
<summary><b>📖 Study Methods</b></summary>

### Active reading
1. Read an example or template.
2. Identify what the example is demonstrating (hook, turning point, escalation, etc.).
3. Copy the structure into your own draft (change premise, characters, setting).
4. Revise once for clarity, once for tension.

### Reverse engineering
1. Pick a story you love (no copying).
2. Fill out one of the templates from this folder.
3. Compare your result with the story’s actual reading experience.
4. Write a new scene using the same structural move.
