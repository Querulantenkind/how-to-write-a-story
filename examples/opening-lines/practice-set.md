# 🏋️ Opening Practice Set

## Drill 1 — Same character, 10 hooks

Write 10 opening lines for the same situation:

- A courier arrives late at night with a package.

Constraint: keep the **event** constant; only change the hook strategy.

## Drill 2 — Same hook, 5 genres

Take this neutral opening:

> The doorbell rang at 2:13 a.m.

Rewrite it as:
- romance
- mystery
- horror
- fantasy
- literary

## Drill 3 — First paragraph escalation

Write one paragraph (5–7 sentences) that:
1. starts normal
2. introduces one small wrong detail
3. ends with a clear problem

## Drill 4 — Promise statement

After writing an opening, write the story promise in one sentence:

- “This story will be about …”

If you can’t, the opening may be too vague.
