# 🧲 Opening Line Patterns (with Original Examples)

These are patterns, not formulas. Use them as practice.

## 1) Contradiction

- **Pattern:** “I always X, except today I Y.”
- **Example:** I never spoke to strangers on trains, except the one who already knew my name.

## 2) Immediate problem

- **Pattern:** “Something is wrong and it’s happening now.”
- **Example:** The fire alarm didn’t scream; it whispered, and everyone still ran.

## 3) Voice-first

- **Pattern:** A strong attitude, worldview, or bias.
- **Example:** People say the sea is calming. Those people have never watched it decide.

## 4) Specificity (concrete detail)

- **Pattern:** A precise image that implies story.
- **Example:** On the kitchen table sat three envelopes: one stamped URGENT, one stamped FINAL, and one with no stamp at all.

## 5) Misdirection

- **Pattern:** Start with an assumption, then flip it.
- **Example:** I was hired to catalog fossils. The first crate contained a hummingbird, still warm.

## 6) A question that creates a gap

- **Pattern:** Ask something the reader wants answered.
- **Example:** How do you apologize to someone you haven’t met yet?

## 7) A promise of genre

- **Pattern:** Signal the genre contract early.
- **Mystery example:** The second body wasn’t dead, but the note pinned to his coat was.
- **Romance example:** The worst part about meeting her was realizing I’d already written her a goodbye.
- **Fantasy example:** The map kept changing because the kingdom refused to stay in one place.
