# ✨ Opening Lines (Examples)

This folder is for studying and practicing **hooks**: first sentences, first paragraphs, and the opening page.

## What’s here

- [opening-line-patterns.md](opening-line-patterns.md) — common hook patterns with original examples
- [opening-analysis-template.md](opening-analysis-template.md) — quick checklist for analyzing any opening
- [practice-set.md](practice-set.md) — rewrite drills and prompts

## How to use

Pick one pattern and write **10 variations**. Keep everything else constant (same character + setting) so you can feel how the hook changes reader expectation.
