# 📈 Plot Structures (Examples)

This folder contains **worked plot outlines** for common structure frameworks.

## What’s here

- [three-act-outline-example.md](three-act-outline-example.md) — original premise outlined in Three-Act Structure
- [save-the-cat-beat-sheet-example.md](save-the-cat-beat-sheet-example.md) — original premise mapped to common beat names

## How to use

- Use these as **maps**, not rules.
- Copy the outline and swap: protagonist, goal, stakes, setting.
- When a beat doesn’t fit your story, write what *your* equivalent beat is.
