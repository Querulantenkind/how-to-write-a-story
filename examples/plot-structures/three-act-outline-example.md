# 🎭 Three-Act Outline (Original Example)

## Premise

A shy baker enters a televised competition to win money for her father’s medical care, but discovers the show is rigged for conflict.

## Act 1 — Setup

- **Status quo:** Quiet bakery; she avoids attention.
- **Inciting incident:** Invitation to the competition (cash prize is the only viable option).
- **Refusal:** Fear of public failure.
- **Commitment:** She signs the contract when bills arrive.
- **End of Act 1:** She’s on set and realizes the producers push contestants into “types.”

## Act 2 — Confrontation

- **New world:** Cameras, time limits, public judging.
- **Fun & games:** Creative bakes; small wins; forming an alliance with another contestant.
- **Rising pressure:** Producer manipulates edits; judges bait her into reacting.
- **Midpoint:** Her ally is eliminated after a manufactured scandal; she’s labeled “ice queen.”
- **Second half escalation:** She starts playing the game—strategic vulnerability, controlled conflict.
- **Low point:** A signature bake fails on live TV; her father’s condition worsens.

## Act 3 — Resolution

- **Insight:** She can’t control the edit, but she can control her choices.
- **Climax:** Final round—she exposes a rule-breaking producer trick on camera while delivering her best bake.
- **Resolution:** She doesn’t win first place, but a sponsor offer and public support fund her father’s care.
- **Closing image:** Back in the bakery—now with a small camera pointed at the counter, by her choice.
