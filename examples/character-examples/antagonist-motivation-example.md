# 🧱 Antagonist Motivation Example (Original)

## Antagonistic force

- **Name:** Director Halden
- **Role:** head of the city’s emergency management office
- **Opposes:** the protagonist’s attempt to warn the public early

## What Halden wants

- **Primary:** prevent panic and protect institutional credibility
- **Secondary:** maintain personal legacy (he wants to be remembered as “the steady hand”)

## What Halden fears

- Being the person who “overreacted” and destroyed trust
- Losing control of information
- Looking weak to political rivals

## Values (the part that makes him believable)

- Stability is a moral good.
- Order saves more lives than truth does.
- People can’t handle uncertainty.

## Methods (how the antagonist applies pressure)

- **Bureaucratic soft power:** access revocations, policy citations, procedural delays
- **Narrative control:** framing whistleblowers as unreliable
- **Plausible deniability:** never giving direct unlawful orders; always “just following process”

## Why this works

The antagonist isn’t evil for fun. He’s dangerous because his values are coherent and his tactics are socially acceptable.
