# 🌱 Protagonist Arc Example (Original)

## Character

- **Name:** Rina Voss
- **Role:** junior emergency dispatcher
- **External goal:** keep callers alive during a citywide blackout
- **Internal need:** stop equating “competence” with “control”

## Starting state

Rina is brilliant at protocols. When something falls outside the script, she freezes and becomes harsh—because harshness feels like control.

## Arc in beats (scene-sized)

1. **Setup:** Rina corrects a trainee mid-call, saving time but humiliating them.
2. **Inciting pressure:** blackout hits; the call queue triples.
3. **First decision:** she refuses to reroute calls to a community hotline (“not official”).
4. **Complication:** official lines fail; callers can’t get through; her “correct” system collapses.
5. **Midpoint insight:** she listens to a recorded call where her tone made a caller hang up.
6. **New approach:** she delegates to the trainee and lets them improvise a calm script.
7. **Test:** a high-stakes call requires choosing between two bad outcomes; she narrates uncertainty honestly.
8. **Climax:** she publicly overrides a supervisor’s order to keep lines “orderly,” choosing messy help over clean metrics.
9. **Resolution:** she apologizes to the trainee and asks them to teach her their improvisation method.

## What this demonstrates

- Internal change shown through **choices under pressure**, not speeches.
- The “flaw” becomes useful (protocols) until it becomes harmful (rigidity).
