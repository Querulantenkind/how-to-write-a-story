# 🗣️ Character Voice Samples (Original)

Same situation, three voices.

## Situation

A character finds a note on their desk that says: **YOU MISCOUNTED.**

---

## Voice A — cynical detective

Anonymous notes are never anonymous.

They’re invitations.

This one sat between my stapler and my coffee like it paid rent.

YOU MISCOUNTED.

Fine. I’ll play.

---

## Voice B — anxious office worker

At first I thought it was a sticky note.

Like a reminder.

Like I’d forgotten milk.

But it was paper—real paper—and the words looked angry.

YOU MISCOUNTED.

My stomach did that thing where it tries to leave my body.

---

## Voice C — lyrical, reflective

The note was small enough to be harmless.

Which is how most harm begins.

YOU MISCOUNTED, it said, as if numbers were a kind of morality.

I held it the way you hold a secret—careful, and already changed.
