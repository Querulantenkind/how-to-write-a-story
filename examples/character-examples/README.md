# 👤 Character Examples (Original)

This folder contains **mini character breakdowns** and **voice/arc examples** you can reuse.

## What’s here

- [protagonist-arc-example.md](protagonist-arc-example.md) — a clear internal/external arc mapped to scenes
- [antagonist-motivation-example.md](antagonist-motivation-example.md) — antagonist force built from values + fear
- [character-voice-samples.md](character-voice-samples.md) — the same situation written in different voices

## How to use

- Copy a template, then change **goal**, **wound**, **fear**, and **methods**.
- For voice: keep the scene objective constant; only change diction and worldview.
