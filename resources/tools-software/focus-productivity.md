- 25 minutes sprint (Pomodoro)
- 5 minutes break
- repeat 2–4 times

## 🧱 Distraction Reduction

Common approaches:

- block distracting sites/apps during sprints
- write full-screen
- keep a notepad for “later” thoughts

## ✅ Habit Tips That Scale

- set a small daily minimum (e.g., 200 words)
- track streaks weekly, not hourly
- keep your “next scene” note ready

## 💡 Energy-Based Planning
