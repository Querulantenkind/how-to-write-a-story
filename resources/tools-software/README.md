# 🔧 Tools & Software

> *A practical guide to choosing tools that support writing (without becoming the project)*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

There’s no “best” writing tool—only what fits your workflow.

This folder helps you choose tools based on:

- what you write (short stories vs novels)
- how you plan (light vs heavy outlining)
- how you revise (fast drafts vs polish-as-you-go)
- how you collaborate (solo vs feedback-heavy)

---

## 🗂️ **Guides in This Folder**

- `writing-software.md` — drafting environments and manuscript handling
- `planning-tools.md` — plotting, timelines, visual organization
- `editing-tools.md` — style checkers, readability tools, revision aids
- `project-management.md` — notes, research, and knowledge bases
- `focus-productivity.md` — distraction blocking, sprints, habits
- `publishing-tools.md` — formatting, submissions, tracking

---

## ✅ Quick Selection Checklist

Choose a tool that:

- you will actually open every day
- makes your next step easier (not “more organized” in theory)
- exports cleanly (backup-friendly)
- doesn’t lock you into a fragile system

---

## 💡 Default Recommendation

If you’re unsure:

- Draft in a simple document tool.
- Track notes in a single place.
- Add specialized tools only when you hit a clear limitation.
