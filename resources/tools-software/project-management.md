# 🧠 Notes & Project Management

> *Systems for research, world notes, continuity, and long-term projects*

---

## 🗂️ What to Track

- character facts that must stay consistent
- timeline events
- world rules (magic/tech/social)
- unresolved questions and future payoffs
- revision notes (“fix this later” list)

---

## ✅ A Simple System That Works

- One place for **writing**
- One place for **notes**
- One place for **tasks**

If you combine them, ensure you can still export and back up easily.

## 💡 Continuity Tip

Create a single “truth file” for:

- names and spellings
- dates and ages
- key locations
- rule exceptions

Update it whenever you revise.
