## 🎯 What Planning Tools Should Do

- make the next scene clearer
- help you track cause/effect and continuity
- reduce cognitive load (characters, dates, subplots)

If a tool doesn’t reduce friction, it’s optional.

## 🧭 Planning Tool Categories

### **Outliners**

Best for: linear thinkers and structured plans

- strengths: clarity, hierarchy, quick rearranging
- watch out: outlining can feel “finished” without writing

### **Timelines**

Best for: mysteries, multi-POV, long spans

- strengths: continuity, scheduling, cause/effect
- watch out: details can multiply quickly

### **Visual Boards**

Best for: theme, mood, relationships, worldbuilding

- strengths: association, discovery, inspiration
- watch out: can drift away from scene-level needs

## ✅ Minimum Viable Planning

If you want the simplest plan that still works:

- one page of premise
- a list of major turning points
- scene goals for the next 3 scenes
