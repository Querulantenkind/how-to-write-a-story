## 🎯 Active Reading Prompts

Use these questions while reading:

- What does the opening promise?
- What does the story make the character choose?
- Where does tension rise, and how is it built?
- What does the author *not* explain directly?
- What would you borrow (structure, voice, pacing) for your own work?
