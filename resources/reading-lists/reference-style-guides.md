## 📖 **Overview**

Reference books don’t make your writing “better” by themselves, but they:

- prevent avoidable errors
- speed up decision-making
- reduce revision churn

Pick a small set you trust and use them consistently.

## 🧾 Style Manuals

## 🌍 Research & World-Building Helpers

Depending on your needs:

- historical atlases
- encyclopedias and subject dictionaries

## ✅ A Simple Consistency Rule

For any project, choose:

- one primary dictionary
- one primary style guide

When you decide a spelling/format choice, write it into a “truth file” and stick to it.
