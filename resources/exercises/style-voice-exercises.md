# 🎨 Style & Voice Exercises

> *Exercises for rhythm, diction, narrative distance, and tone*

---

## 🎼 1) Rhythm Swap (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Feel how sentence length changes mood.

Write 150–250 words in:

1. Mostly short sentences.
2. Mostly long sentences.

Compare the emotional effect.

## 🧷 2) Diction Dial (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Control voice through word choice.

Pick a neutral event: someone enters a room.
Write it three ways:

- Formal / elevated diction
- Casual / conversational diction
- Harsh / clipped diction

---

## 🔭 3) Distance Shift (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Learn narrative distance.

Write the same moment twice:

- Distant: summary, broader context
- Close: sensory detail, immediate thought

Keep the events identical.

## 🧪 4) Imitation With a Twist (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Expand your toolkit without copying.

1. Choose a paragraph from a book you admire.
2. Do **not** reuse the content.
3. Imitate only the *technique* (rhythm, syntax, structure).
4. Write a new paragraph about a different subject.

Focus on craft, not mimicry.
