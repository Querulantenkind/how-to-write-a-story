# 📈 Plot & Structure Exercises

> *Exercises for cause/effect, escalation, and turning points*

## 🔗 1) Because / Therefore Chain (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Replace “and then” plotting.

Write 6 story events. Each must connect via **because** or **therefore**.

Example structure:

- Event 1 happens.
- **Because** of Event 1, Event 2 happens.
- **Therefore** Event 3 happens.

Now identify which event is the first true turning point.

## 🧨 2) The Turning Point Rewrite (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Make a scene irreversible.

Take a scene idea and write two endings:

1. The ending where nothing truly changes.
2. The ending where the outcome creates a **new problem**.

Keep #2.

## 🎯 3) Goal / Obstacle / Cost (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Give a scene dramatic shape.

Fill in:

- Goal: _________________________________
- Obstacle: _________________________________
- Cost: _________________________________

Write 250–400 words that pay the cost on-page.

## 📌 4) Reveal Placement (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Control information.

Pick a secret.

- The reader knows at: _________________________________
- The POV knows at: _________________________________
- The antagonist knows at: _________________________________

Write a short sequence where *who knows what* creates tension.

## ✅ Quick Diagnostic
