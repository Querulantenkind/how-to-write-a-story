## 👁️ 1) The Specificity Pass (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Replace vague description with concrete detail.

Write 5 sentences describing a place.
Then revise each sentence by adding:

- one precise noun (brand, object type, tool, material)
- one sensory detail (sound, smell, texture)
- one implication (what this detail suggests about the people here)

## 🎧 2) Two Senses Only (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Control overload.

Describe a setting using only **two senses** (no visual description).

Examples:

- sound + smell
- touch + temperature
- taste + sound

## 🌫️ 3) Mood Overlay (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Make setting reflect (or contradict) emotion.

Write the same room twice:

1. The POV feels safe.
2. The POV feels threatened.

Keep the facts mostly the same; change the emphasis.

## 🧭 4) The Characterized Location (20 minutes)

**Goal:** Make the world feel alive.

Answer:

- What does this place want? _________________________________
- What does it hide? _________________________________
- What does it punish? _________________________________

Write 200–300 words that treat the setting like an active force.
