# 🗣️ Dialogue Exercises

> *Exercises for subtext, power dynamics, and character voice*

---

## ⚡ 1) Subtext Only (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Make dialogue mean more than it says.

Prompt: Two characters discuss something ordinary (tea, a meeting, a repair), but what they *really* want is:

- an apology
- a confession
- a yes/no decision

Write 250–400 words where the real topic is never named.

---

## 🎭 2) Power Tilt (10 minutes)

**Goal:** Make each line change the balance.

Write 12 lines of dialogue.

- Line 1–4: Character A has power.
- Line 5–8: Character B gains power.
- Line 9–12: The power becomes uncertain.

No exposition between lines; only dialogue.

## 🔥 3) The Unasked Question (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Create tension through avoidance.

Write a conversation where one character wants to ask a question but can’t.

- What they want to ask: _________________________________
- Why they can’t: _________________________________

**Constraint:** The question must be implied at least 3 times.

## 🎧 4) Dialogue With Action Anchors (15 minutes)

**Goal:** Keep dialogue grounded.

Write a conversation that includes **one physical action** every 2–3 lines (pouring, fixing, packing, cleaning). The actions should reveal emotion.

---

## ✅ Quick Diagnostic

If your dialogue feels flat, pick one fix:

- Give each speaker a **goal** in the conversation.
- Add **stakes** (what happens if they fail to get what they want).
- Add a **constraint** (time pressure, public setting, someone listening).
- Add subtext: let them talk about something else.
