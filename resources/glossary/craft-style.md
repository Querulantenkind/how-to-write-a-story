# 🎨 Glossary: Craft & Style

> *Terms for POV, voice, pacing, and prose technique*

---

## **Point of View (POV)**

The lens through which the story is told (who experiences the scene and how).

## **Voice**

The distinct “sound” of the narration: diction, rhythm, attitude, and perspective.

## **Tone**

The emotional coloring of the narration (warm, grim, comedic, detached).

## **Pacing**

The felt speed of the story, controlled by tension, sentence rhythm, scene length, and information flow.

## **Show vs Tell**

“Showing” uses action, detail, and implication; “telling” summarizes or explains directly. Both are tools.

## **Subtext**

The meaning beneath the words/actions; what characters really want or fear.

## **Narrative Distance**

How close the narration is to a character’s immediate thoughts and sensations.

## **Exposition**

Information given to the reader about the world, history, or context.

## **Info Dump**

Exposition delivered in a heavy block that stalls momentum.

## **Foreshadowing**

Early hints that prepare the reader for later events.

## **Theme**

The underlying idea the story explores (often expressed through choices and consequences).

## **Motif**

A repeated image or element that reinforces theme or emotion.

## 💡 Common Confusions

- **Voice vs Tone:** voice is the narrator’s identity; tone is the mood in a moment.
- **Subtext vs ambiguity:** subtext is intentional hidden meaning; ambiguity can be accidental.
