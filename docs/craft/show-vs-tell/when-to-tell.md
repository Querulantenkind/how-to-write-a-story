# ⚡ When to Tell Instead of Show

> *"Show, don't tell is not an absolute rule. It's a preference for a certain kind of writing at a certain time."* — Charles Baxter

## 📖 **The Heresy: Sometimes You Should Tell**

"Show, don't tell" is one of the most repeated rules in writing—and one of the most misunderstood. The truth is:

### **✨ Great fiction is a balance of showing AND telling.**

If you showed everything, your novel would be 10,000 pages long and unbearably slow. Strategic **telling** is:
- ✅ Necessary
- ✅ Efficient
- ✅ Often more effective than showing

The key is knowing **when to use each technique**.

---

## 🎯 **When to Tell: Core Situations**

### **1. Unimportant Information**

**TELL when details don't deserve scene-level attention.**

**❌ Over-Showing:**
> Sarah walked to her car, keys jingling in her hand. She pressed the unlock button. The car beeped twice. She opened the door, slid into the driver's seat, adjusted the mirror, inserted the key, turned the ignition, and drove to the grocery store.

**✅ Strategic Telling:**
> Sarah drove to the grocery store.

**Why it works:**
- No emotional significance
- Not relevant to plot
- Readers don't need the detail

---

### **2. Time Transitions**

**TELL to compress time efficiently.**

**❌ Showing Every Day:**
> Monday morning, she woke up at 6 AM, showered, dressed, ate breakfast... [repeat for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday]

**✅ Efficient Telling:**
> The week crawled by.

**Examples:**
- "Three months passed before he called."
- "She spent the summer working double shifts."
- "Years later, he still remembered that conversation."

**Why it works:**
- Moves story forward
- Avoids boring repetition
- Focuses on what matters

---

### **3. Backstory & Exposition**

**TELL when you need to convey information quickly.**

**❌ Showing Everything:**
> *Flashback to childhood. Scene of father leaving. Scene of mother's struggle. Scene of moving to new city. Scene of...*

**✅ Strategic Telling:**
> "She'd learned early that people leave. Her father had, and after him, everyone else who mattered."

**Why it works:**
- Delivers context without stopping the story
- Readers get necessary information
- Maintains forward momentum

**Caveat:** Important emotional backstory may deserve showing through scenes or flashbacks. Tell the setup; show the core wounds.

---

### **4. Setting Up What You'll Show**

**TELL to create contrast and emphasis.**

**Pattern:**
```
TELL (general) → SHOW (specific)
```

**Example:**
> The party was awkward. *(Tell—general)*
>
> Marcus stood in the corner, nursing the same beer for an hour, counting down until he could leave without seeming rude. Every conversation died the moment he approached. *(Show—specific)*

**Why it works:**
- Establishes context
- The specific showing has more impact
- Creates rhythm

---

### **5. Complex Concepts**

**TELL when showing would be confusing or convoluted.**

**❌ Trying to Show:**
> He looked at the equation, his mind making connections between the variables, realizing that if you substitute x for y, and carry the remainder... [three paragraphs of mathematical reasoning shown through action]

**✅ Clear Telling:**
> "The math was elegant. Simple. Brilliant."

**Why it works:**
- Some concepts resist dramatization
- Clarity trumps showing
- Moves story along

**Use for:**
- Technical explanations
- Philosophical concepts
- Abstract ideas

---

### **6. Summarizing Repeated Actions**

**TELL to avoid repetitive showing.**

**❌ Showing Every Instance:**
> [Monday: He goes to therapy, scene]
> [Wednesday: He goes to therapy, scene]
> [Friday: He goes to therapy, scene]
> [Repeat for weeks]

**✅ Summary Telling:**
> "Over the next three months, therapy became routine. Some sessions he talked. Some sessions he didn't. But he kept showing up."

**Why it works:**
- Avoids redundancy
- Shows pattern without belaboring
- Maintains pacing

---

### **7. Establishing Tone & Authority**

**TELL when you want narrative authority or omniscient perspective.**

**Example (Jane Austen):**
> "It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

**Example (Gabriel García Márquez):**
> "Many years later, as he faced the firing squad, Colonel Aurelino Buendía was to remember that distant afternoon when his father took him to discover ice."

**Why it works:**
- Creates narrative voice
- Establishes scope
- Sets tone immediately

---

### **8. After Showing, for Emphasis**

**TELL after showing to drive the point home.**

**Pattern:**
```
SHOW (specific) → TELL (meaning)
```

**Example:**
> She packed his clothes into boxes, labeled them in neat handwriting, and left them on the porch. Changed the locks. Deleted his number from her phone. Burned the photos.
>
> She was done. *(Tell for emphasis)*

**Why it works:**
- Shows the actions first (readers experience)
- Tells the conclusion (confirms interpretation)
- Provides satisfying closure

## ⚖️ **Show vs. Tell: The Decision Matrix**

### **SHOW When:**
✅ **Emotional stakes are high** — Important moments deserve showing  
✅ **Action is happening now** — Present-time events  
✅ **Character is revealing themselves** — Key personality moments  
✅ **Building tension** — Showing creates suspense  
✅ **Readers need to experience** — Immersion matters  
✅ **The scene is pivotal** — Critical plot points  

### **TELL When:**
✅ **Information is necessary but boring** — Transit, routine  
✅ **Time needs to pass** — Transitions, summaries  
✅ **Backstory is needed** — Context without full scenes  
✅ **Pacing is dragging** — Speed things up  
✅ **Setting up a showing moment** — Context for contrast  
✅ **The concept is abstract** — Complex ideas  
✅ **You've already shown it** — Avoid repetition

## 🎨 **The Show-Tell Spectrum**

### **It's not binary—it's a spectrum:**

```
PURE TELLING ←――――――――――→ PURE SHOWING
     ↓                            ↓
"She was sad"          "Tears streamed down her face.
                        She couldn't speak. The world
                        went blurry. Nothing would ever
                        be the same."
```

### **Middle Ground (Best for Most Prose):**

**Showing with some telling:**
> "She was sad—the kind of sad that makes you forget to eat, forget to sleep. She walked through her apartment touching nothing, seeing nothing, wondering how life could just... continue."

**Combines:**
- Statement of emotion (tell)
- Specific details (show)
- Internal experience (show)

## ✍️ **How to Tell Well**

### **1. Use Strong, Specific Verbs**

**Weak Telling:**
> "She was mad."

**Strong Telling:**
> "She seethed."

### **2. Add Brief Showing Details**

**Pure Telling:**
> "Time passed."

**Telling with Detail:**
> "Three weeks passed—three weeks of silence, of avoiding his calls, of pretending she was fine."

### **3. Use Voice**

**Generic:**
> "He was nervous."

**With Voice:**
> "He was nervous as hell, and trying not to show it, which probably made it worse."

### **4. Tell with Authority**

**Tentative:**
> "She seemed to be happy."

**Authoritative:**
> "She was happy. For the first time in years, genuinely happy."

---

## 🎭 **Examples of Effective Telling**

### **Jane Austen:**
> "Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three and twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character."

*Complex character summary that would take chapters to show.*

### **Gabriel García Márquez:**
> "The world was so recent that many things lacked names, and in order to indicate them it was necessary to point."

*Establishes setting instantly through telling.*

### **Ursula K. Le Guin:**
> "The king was pregnant."

*One sentence of telling that shows mastery—hooks reader immediately.*

### **Toni Morrison:**
> "124 was spiteful. Full of a baby's venom."

*Tells us the house is haunted, but in a way that shows her voice.*

### **Joan Didion:**
> "We tell ourselves stories in order to live."

*Pure telling that becomes profound through truth and voice.*

---

## ❌ **Bad Telling vs. Good Telling**

### **Bad Telling:**

**Problem: Generic, lazy, robbing reader of experience**

> "She was sad because her boyfriend left her. She felt terrible. It was the worst day ever."

### **Good Telling:**

**Solution: Specific, efficient, serves the story**

> "He'd been gone three weeks when she realized she didn't miss him—she missed having someone to miss."

**Difference:**
- Specific vs. generic
- Insightful vs. obvious
- Voice vs. bland
- Efficient vs. redundant

## 🎯 **Practice Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Identify Show vs. Tell**

Read a chapter of a favorite book. Highlight:
- **Blue** = Pure showing
- **Yellow** = Pure telling
- **Green** = Mixture

What's the ratio? When does the author choose each?

### **Exercise 2: Convert & Compare**

Take a paragraph you've shown. Rewrite it as pure telling.  
Take a paragraph you've told. Rewrite it as pure showing.

Which works better? Why?

### **Exercise 3: Time Compression**

Write a character's entire day showing every detail (exhausting, right?).

Now compress it to 3 sentences of telling that captures the essence.

### **Exercise 4: The Setup**

Write a scene using this pattern:
1. Tell (general) — 1 sentence
2. Show (specific) — 1 paragraph
3. Tell (conclusion) — 1 sentence

### **Exercise 5: Efficient Backstory**

Write a character's traumatic backstory:
- **Version A:** Show it in a full scene (500 words)
- **Version B:** Tell it efficiently (50 words)

Which version would work better in your novel?
