# 💭 Internal Monologue: Thoughts and Feelings

> *"The real voyage of discovery consists not in seeking new landscapes, but in having new eyes."* — Marcel Proust

---

## 📖 **What is Internal Monologue?**

**Internal monologue** (also called interior monologue or internal dialogue) is the **thoughts and feelings of your POV character**—the running commentary inside their head that readers can access.

It's the voice of consciousness, showing:
- 💭 **What they think** about events
- ❤️ **How they feel** emotionally
- 🤔 **How they interpret** what happens
- 🧠 **Their reasoning** and decision-making
- 👤 **Their unique voice** and personality

---

## 🎯 **Why Internal Monologue Matters**

### **Benefits:**
✨ **Creates Intimacy** — Readers access private thoughts  
🎭 **Reveals Character** — Interior life shows who they truly are  
💭 **Provides Context** — Explains motivations and reactions  
🎨 **Establishes Voice** — Character's thought-patterns = personality  
⚡ **Controls Pacing** — Can speed up or slow down narrative  
🔍 **Adds Layers** — Gap between thought and speech = subtext  

---

## 🎨 **Types of Internal Monologue**

### **1. Direct Thought**

Character's exact thoughts, unfiltered and immediate.

**Formatted in italics (most common):**
> Sarah unlocked the door. *Please let him be home. Please.*

**Without italics (integrated):**
> Sarah unlocked the door. Please let him be home, she thought.

**Use for:**
- Intense emotional moments
- Urgent thoughts
- Character's exact words to themselves

---

### **2. Indirect Thought**

Reported thought, filtered through narration.

**Example:**
> Sarah wondered if he'd be home. She hoped so. She needed to talk to him.

**Use for:**
- Less intense moments
- Smoother narrative flow
- When voice is similar to narrative voice

---

### **3. Stream of Consciousness**

Unstructured, flowing thoughts mimicking how minds actually work.

**Example:**
> Keys. Did she have her keys? Pocket—yes. And the report. Had to remember the report. God, she was tired. When was the last time she'd slept properly? Tuesday? Wednesday? The apartment would be dark. He'd be asleep already. She could be quiet. She was always quiet.

**Use for:**
- Heightened emotional states
- Showing scattered thinking
- Creating intimacy
- Literary effect

---

### **4. Free Indirect Discourse**

Blended narrator and character voice—thoughts woven seamlessly into narration.

**Example:**
> She opened the door slowly. Of course he wasn't home. Why would he be? He was never home anymore.

*No italics, no "she thought," but clearly her perspective and voice.*

**Use for:**
- Deep POV
- Smooth, invisible technique
- When narrator = character voice

---

## ⚖️ **Show vs. Tell in Internal Monologue**

### **Even thoughts can show or tell:**

**❌ Telling Through Thought:**
> *I'm so angry at him. He makes me furious.*

**✅ Showing Through Thought:**
> *Every excuse. Every broken promise. He always had a reason, didn't he? Well, not this time.*

**The difference:**
- Showing = specific, revealing details
- Telling = naming emotion without context

---

## 🎭 **Internal Monologue vs. Narration**

### **The Spectrum:**

```
PURE NARRATION ←――――――――→ PURE THOUGHT
      ↓                          ↓
Distant, objective      Intimate, subjective
```

**Distant Narration:**
> She entered the room and saw him waiting.

**Filtered Through Character:**
> She opened the door. He was waiting, of course. Always waiting.

**Direct Thought:**
> *He's waiting. God. What do I even say to him?*

---

## 🎯 **When to Use Internal Monologue**

### **✅ Use Internal Monologue When:**

**1. Processing Events**
> *He'd said he loved her. Past tense. When had that changed?*

**2. Making Decisions**
> *She could tell him. Right now. Get it over with. Or she could wait. Waiting was safer.*

**3. Revealing Motivation**
> *The money didn't matter. It had never been about the money. It was about proving he was wrong.*

**4. Showing Internal Conflict**
> *Tell the truth. Lie to protect him. Tell the truth. Lie. Truth. Lie.*

**5. Adding Context Readers Need**
> *The last time she'd been here, her mother was still alive.*

**6. Creating Dramatic Irony**
> *Everything would be fine. She was sure of it.*  
> *(Readers know: it won't be fine.)*

**7. Revealing Character Voice**
> *Great. Just great. Because this day couldn't possibly get any worse.*

---

## ❌ **When NOT to Use Internal Monologue**

### **Avoid When:**

**1. It's Redundant**
❌ Bad:
> He slammed the door. *God, I'm so angry!*

The action already showed anger.

**2. It Slows Action Scenes**
❌ Bad:
> The bullet whizzed past his head. *That was close. He could have died. Death was a very real possibility here.*

Keep action moving.

**3. It States the Obvious**
❌ Bad:
> "I love you," he said.  
> *He just told me he loves me!*

Readers got it.

**4. It Tells What You Should Show**
❌ Bad:
> *I need to cry. I'm going to cry now.*

Just show them crying.

---

## 🌊 **Varying Internal Monologue**

### **✅ Best Practices:**

**1. Match Intensity to Moment**

**Low intensity:**
> She wondered if she'd locked the door.

**High intensity:**
> *The door. Had she locked it? She couldn't remember. God, she couldn't remember anything anymore.*

**2. Use Rhythm for Emotion**

**Calm, measured:**
> She had three options. She could call him. She could go to his house. Or she could do nothing.

**Panicked, fragmented:**
> Call him. No. Bad idea. Go to his house? Worse. Do nothing? Impossible.*

**3. Vary Sentence Length**

**Contemplative (long sentences):**
> *She'd known him for seventeen years, and in all that time, through everything they'd been through, she'd never once heard him admit he was wrong.*

**Urgent (short sentences):**
> *Run. Now. Don't look back.*

**4. Show Thought Patterns**

Different characters think differently:

**Analytical character:**
> *The evidence pointed to three possibilities. First, he was lying. Second, he was mistaken. Third—and this was the option she liked least—she was wrong.*

**Emotional character:**
> *He was lying. He had to be. Because if he wasn't, if this was real, if he actually meant it...*

**Cynical character:**
> *Of course he was lying. Everyone lied. That was the first rule: never trust anyone who said they cared.*

---

## 🎨 **Deep POV: Maximizing Intimacy**

### **Deep POV = Minimal distance between reader and character**

**Standard POV:**
> She saw him across the room and thought he looked tired.

**Deep POV:**
> He stood across the room. God, he looked tired.

**Technique:**
- Remove filter words (*thought, felt, saw, heard, wondered*)
- Weave thought into narration
- Use character's voice for description
- No separation between thought and narrative

---

## 💬 **Internal Monologue vs. Dialogue**

### **The Gap Creates Character**

**What they think:**
> *God, this is the worst idea you've ever had.*

**What they say:**
> "Sounds great. I'm in."

**This creates:**
- 🎭 **Subtext** — True feelings hidden
- 👤 **Character complexity** — Internal conflict
- ⚡ **Tension** — Readers know the truth
- 💭 **Sympathy** — We understand their struggle

---

## 🔧 **Technical Considerations**

### **Formatting Direct Thought:**

**Option 1: Italics (most common)**
> *I can't believe he said that.*

**Option 2: Italics with thought tag**
> *I can't believe he said that,* she thought.

**Option 3: No italics, integrated**
> I can't believe he said that, she thought.

**Option 4: Free indirect (no markers)**
> She couldn't believe he'd said that.

**Consistency is key.** Choose one method and stick with it.

---

### **Thought Tags:**

**Common tags:**
- she thought
- he wondered
- she realized
- he remembered

**Use sparingly:**
- Context usually makes it clear it's thought
- Too many tags = clunky prose
- Deep POV often eliminates tags entirely

---

## 🎯 **Common Internal Monologue Mistakes**

### **1. Too Much Introspection**

**Problem:**
> *Why did she feel this way? Was it because of her childhood? Her mother had always been distant. And her father—well, he'd left when she was seven. That had shaped her, hadn't it? Made her afraid of abandonment. But was that really it? Or was there something else?*

**Solution:**
Introspection is good. Pages of it kills pacing. Break it up with action.

---

### **2. Telling Emotions in Thought**

**Problem:**
> *I'm sad. So sad. The sadness is overwhelming.*

**Solution:**
> *The apartment's too quiet. It's been three weeks and it's still too quiet.*

Show even in thought.

---

### **3. Unnatural Exposition**

**Problem:**
> *As I walked down the street I grew up on, I remembered that I was born here twenty-eight years ago, and my father was a lawyer, and I had two sisters...*

No one thinks like this.

**Solution:**
> The house looked smaller than she remembered. Twenty-eight years and it had shrunk.

Natural thought patterns.

---

### **4. Repetitive Thought Patterns**

**Problem:**
Every internal monologue starts with "I thought..." or uses the same structure.

**Solution:**
Vary your techniques—direct, indirect, free indirect. Mix it up.

---

### **5. Breaking Voice**

**Problem:**
> *Why do I persist in these endeavors when I know them to be fruitless?*

*(Character is a modern teenager.)*

**Solution:**
Thoughts should match how character actually thinks.

> *Why do I keep doing this? It's pointless.*

---

## 🎭 **Internal Monologue for Different POVs**

### **First Person:**
- Most natural for internal monologue
- Everything is thought, in a sense
- Narrator IS the character

**Example:**
> I couldn't look at him. If I looked at him, I'd cry, and I was done crying over Marcus.

---

### **Third Person Limited:**
- Internal monologue of POV character
- Can use direct or indirect thought
- Balance narration and thought

**Example:**
> She couldn't look at him. *If I look at him, I'll cry.* And she was done crying over Marcus.

---

### **Third Person Omniscient:**
- Can access multiple characters' thoughts
- Usually more distant
- Less intimate internal monologue

**Example:**
> She couldn't look at him. Marcus waited, hoping she would. Neither understood what the other needed.

---

### **Second Person:**
- "You" thinks the thoughts
- Intimate but unusual

**Example:**
> You can't look at him. If you look at him, you'll cry, and you're done crying over Marcus.

---

## 🎯 **Practice Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Thought vs. Speech**

Write a dialogue scene where every line has:
1. What the character says
2. What they're actually thinking

Make them contradict.

---

### **Exercise 2: Stream of Consciousness**

Set a timer for 5 minutes. Write stream-of-consciousness from your character's POV about a stressful situation. Don't edit. Let it flow.

---

### **Exercise 3: Three Techniques**

Write the same internal moment three ways:
1. Direct thought (italics)
2. Indirect thought (reported)
3. Free indirect discourse (blended)

Which works best for your story?

---

### **Exercise 4: Character Voice**

Take three different characters. Write how each would think about the same event (e.g., a cancelled flight). Make their thought patterns distinct.

---

### **Exercise 5: Deep POV Conversion**

Take a paragraph written in standard third person. Convert it to deep POV by:
- Removing filter words
- Adding character voice
- Blending thought and narration

---

## 📚 **Examples to Study**

### **Masters of Internal Monologue:**

**Virginia Woolf (*Mrs. Dalloway*):**
> "She would not say of anyone in the world now that they were this or were that. She felt very young; at the same time unspeakably aged."

**Sally Rooney (*Normal People*):**
> "He probably should have said something, but he didn't know what. Sorry? He wasn't even sure what he would be apologizing for."

**Ian McEwan (*Atonement*):**
> "The anticipation and dread he felt at seeing her was also a kind of sensual pleasure, and surrounding it was a nervous pleasure—the pleasure of being worked up."
