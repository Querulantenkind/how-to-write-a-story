### ✅ **SHOWING EMOTION**

"Sarah stared at his empty closet. She'd forgotten to close the door again. Three months, and she still set the table for two."

"Marcus couldn't look his daughter in the eye. 'I'm sorry,' he said for the tenth time. It still wasn't enough."

"Elena's hand shook so badly she couldn't turn the key. Behind her, footsteps echoed in the stairwell."

## 💔 **Common Emotions & How to Show Them**

### **ANGER**

**❌ Telling:**
> "He was furious."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "His jaw clenched so tight his teeth ached"
- "Heat crawled up his neck"
- "His fists balled at his sides"

**Behavioral:**
- "He threw the report across the room"
- "Each word came out clipped, precise"
- "He left without closing the door"

**Cognitive:**
- *Every excuse she'd ever made played on loop in his head*
- *He couldn't hear past the roaring in his ears*

**Full Example:**
> "The coffee cup shattered against the wall. Mark didn't remember throwing it. His chest heaved, his vision narrowed to a pinpoint, and all he could think was how many times—how many goddamn times—he'd given her a second chance."

---

### **FEAR**

**❌ Telling:**
> "She was terrified."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "Her mouth went dry"
- "Ice slid down her spine"
- "Her heart hammered against her ribs"

**Behavioral:**
- "She froze, couldn't make her legs move"
- "Her voice came out a whisper"
- "She backed toward the door, not turning away"

**Cognitive:**
- *The worst-case scenarios cascaded through her mind*
- *Every shadow became a threat*

**Full Example:**
> "The floorboard creaked. Lisa's breath stopped. She pressed herself against the wall, phone clutched in her sweating palm, thumb hovering over 9-1-1. Another creak. Closer. *Just the house settling*, she told herself, but her body didn't believe it."

---

### **GRIEF**

**❌ Telling:**
> "He was devastated by his mother's death."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "His chest felt hollow, like something vital had been scooped out"
- "Tears wouldn't come. He tried. Nothing."
- "He couldn't swallow past the lump in his throat"

**Behavioral:**
- "He stood at her closet, breathing in the scent of her perfume still clinging to her clothes"
- "The voicemail sat on his phone, two months old. He couldn't delete it. Couldn't listen to it either."
- "Everyone kept talking and he nodded at the right times and had no idea what anyone said"

**Cognitive:**
- *He kept reaching for his phone to call her. Had to remember, every time, that she wouldn't answer*
- *The world looked the same. How was that possible?*

**Full Example:**
> "Tom opened the fridge. The casserole sat on the second shelf, tin foil note still attached: *Heat at 350 for 30 min. Love you! —Mom*. He'd kept it there for three weeks. Couldn't eat it. Couldn't throw it away. It was the last thing she'd made, her handwriting, that little heart over the 'i'. His hand shook as he closed the door."

---

### **LOVE**

**❌ Telling:**
> "She loved him."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "Her pulse jumped when his name appeared on her phone"
- "She caught herself smiling at nothing"
- "She fit perfectly under his arm"

**Behavioral:**
- "She always made his coffee just right: two sugars, splash of cream, never too hot"
- "She kept his photo in her wallet, behind her license where no one would see"
- "She listened to his voicemails when she couldn't sleep"

**Cognitive:**
- *She catalogued every detail: the way he tapped his fingers when he was thinking, the cowlick at his hairline, how he always smelled like cedar*
- *Her first thought every morning: him*

**Full Example:**
> "Maya kept his spare key on her keychain even though they'd broken up six months ago. Sometimes, late at night, she'd hold it and wonder if it still fit his lock. Probably. He never changed anything. That was the problem, wasn't it? Or maybe the problem was that she still carried the key."

---

### **ANXIETY**

**❌ Telling:**
> "He was anxious about the interview."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "His stomach churned"
- "Sweat prickled at his hairline"
- "His leg bounced uncontrollably"

**Behavioral:**
- "He checked his watch every thirty seconds"
- "He rehearsed his answers again. And again."
- "He couldn't sit still—paced the lobby, sat, stood, paced again"

**Cognitive:**
- *Every possible question they might ask, every wrong answer he might give*
- *What if they'd already decided? What if this was just a formality?*

**Full Example:**
> "James smoothed his tie for the fourth time. Or was it the fifth? His prepared answers tangled in his head, mixing with catastrophic scenarios. The receptionist called his name and his stomach plummeted. He stood. Sat back down. Wiped his palms on his pants. This was fine. Everything was fine. He forced himself upright and tried to remember how to walk normally."

---

### **GUILT**

**❌ Telling:**
> "She felt guilty."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "Her face burned"
- "She couldn't meet his eyes"
- "Weight settled in her chest like a stone"

**Behavioral:**
- "She apologized for the third time"
- "She bought him coffee every morning for a week"
- "She avoided the places they used to go"

**Cognitive:**
- *The moment replayed constantly: what she should have said, what she should have done*
- *How did you apologize for something that couldn't be undone?*

**Full Example:**
> "'It's fine,' Jake said, but it wasn't, and they both knew it. Rachel opened her mouth to apologize again—she'd lost count of how many times—but what was the point? Sorry didn't unbreak trust. She picked at the label on her water bottle, peeling it into tiny strips, because looking at him hurt too much."

---

### **JOY**

**❌ Telling:**
> "She was happy."

**✅ Showing:**

**Physical:**
- "She couldn't stop grinning, face aching with it"
- "Energy buzzed through her like electricity"
- "She felt light, like she might float away"

**Behavioral:**
- "She laughed at everything, couldn't help it"
- "She danced in the kitchen while making breakfast"
- "She called everyone she knew to share the news"

**Cognitive:**
- *Everything seemed brighter, sharper, more alive*
- *For once, her brain was quiet—no worries, no second-guessing*

**Full Example:**
> "The acceptance letter sat on the table. Emma read it again. Still real. She jumped up, danced around the kitchen, texted everyone in her contacts, made coffee she forgot to drink. Her roommate came home and found her staring at the letter, crying and laughing at the same time, unable to articulate why. 'I got in,' she finally managed. 'I got in.'"

## 🎨 **Advanced Techniques**

### **1. Metaphor for Emotion**

Use metaphor to convey complex feelings.

**Example:**
> "Grief was a ocean, and some days she was treading water, and some days she was drowning."

---

### **2. Behavior That Contradicts Emotion**

Show emotional complexity through mixed signals.

**Example:**
> "She smiled brightly and said, 'I'm fine,' while her hands twisted the napkin into shreds beneath the table."

---

### **3. Displacement Activity**

Characters do one thing to avoid feeling/showing another emotion.

**Example:**
> "He couldn't think about his father, so he cleaned. Scrubbed the kitchen till his hands were raw. Organized the garage. Vacuumed the stairs. At 2 AM, he ran out of rooms and sat in the spotless kitchen and finally let himself cry."

---

### **4. Objects as Emotional Anchors**

Use objects to carry emotional weight.

**Example:**
> "Her wedding ring sat in the jewelry box. She hadn't worn it in six months. Hadn't thrown it away either."

---

### **5. Environment Reflecting Emotion**

Use setting to mirror internal state.

**Example:**
> "The apartment had stopped being home. Dishes piled in the sink. Mail stacked by the door, unopened. The plants were dying. He couldn't bring himself to care."

## ⚖️ **Balancing Emotion**

### **✅ Best Practices:**

**1. Earn Big Emotions**
- Build to emotional peaks
- Don't start at maximum intensity
- Give readers time to invest

**2. Vary Emotional Expression**
- Not every character cries when sad
- Not every character yells when angry
- Match expression to personality

**3. Use Emotional Restraint**
- Sometimes understatement hits harder
- The emotion readers supply is powerful
- Leave room for interpretation

**4. Layer Contradictory Emotions**
- People rarely feel just one thing
- Combine emotions for complexity
- Love and resentment, joy and fear

**5. Consider Context**
- Public vs. private expression
- Cultural factors
- Character's emotional vocabulary

## ❌ **Common Mistakes**

### **1. Emotional Telling**

**Problem:**
> "She was sad and angry and confused and hurt."

**Solution:**
> "She stared at the message. Read it again. Threw the phone on the couch, picked it up, read it a third time. What the hell did *'I think we need space'* even mean?"

### **2. Generic Physical Reactions**

**Problem:**
> "His heart raced. His palms sweated. His stomach churned."

**Solution:**
Find specific, unique details that reveal emotion while staying true to your character's voice.

### **3. Melodrama**

**Problem:**
> "Her heart shattered into a million pieces and she felt like she would die from the unbearable pain."

**Solution:**
> "She couldn't breathe properly. Every breath felt manual, something she had to remember to do."

### **4. Naming Emotion After Showing**

**Problem:**
> "Tears streamed down her face. Her shoulders shook with sobs. She was devastated."

**Solution:**
> "Tears streamed down her face. Her shoulders shook with sobs."

*Stop before the redundant label.*

## 📚 **Examples to Study**

### **Masters of Emotional Showing:**

**Kazuo Ishiguro (*The Remains of the Day*):**
> "I mean to say, your lordship can see for himself that I am not in the best of health, and that in order to continue with my duties I must husband my strength. I cannot therefore any longer travel around the house. I must ask that I be permitted to have my employment strictly limited to the duties I performed ten years ago."

*Grief and denial, shown through excessive formality and avoidance.*

**Joan Didion (*The Year of Magical Thinking*):**
> "I could not trust myself to present a coherent face to the world."

*Understated, devastating.*

**Celeste Ng (*Little Fires Everywhere*):**
> "It came, over and over, down to this: What made someone a mother? Was it biology alone, or was it love?"

*Complex emotion through question, not statement.*
