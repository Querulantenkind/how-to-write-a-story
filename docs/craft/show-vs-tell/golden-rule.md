## 📖 **What is Show vs. Tell?**

**Show vs. Tell** is one of the most fundamental principles in fiction writing. It's the difference between:

### ❌ **TELLING**
*Stating information directly*

"Sarah was angry."

"The house was old and creepy."

"John didn't trust his brother."

### ✅ **SHOWING**
*Revealing through action, detail, and implication*

"Sarah slammed the door so hard the frame rattled."

"The porch sagged under broken shutters, and something skittered in the walls."

"John kept his wallet in his front pocket whenever his brother visited."

## 🎯 **Why "Show" Matters**

### **Showing:**
✨ **Engages readers actively** — they participate in discovery  
🎭 **Creates vivid experience** — readers feel present  
💭 **Allows interpretation** — readers form own impressions  
❤️ **Generates emotional connection** — showing = feeling  
🎨 **Demonstrates writer's craft** — sophisticated technique  

### **Telling:**
📝 Efficient for necessary information  
⚡ Speeds pacing when needed  
🗺️ Provides context or summary  
⏱️ Handles time jumps

## 🔍 **How to Show Instead of Tell**

### **1. Use Sensory Details**

Instead of naming an emotion or state, describe what can be **seen, heard, felt, tasted, or smelled**.

<details>
<summary><b>Examples: Sensory Showing</b></summary>

#### **TELL:**
> The bakery smelled good.

#### **SHOW:**
> Warm butter and cinnamon rolled through the doorway, wrapping around her like a blanket from childhood.

---

#### **TELL:**
> It was a beautiful morning.

#### **SHOW:**
> Sunlight streamed through the leaves, dappling the sidewalk in gold. Birds competed in song from the oak tree, and the air tasted of rain-washed earth.

---

#### **TELL:**
> The room was messy.

#### **SHOW:**
> Clothes draped over the chair, the desk, the lampshade. Coffee rings overlapped on the nightstand. Something under the bed might have been alive once.

</details>

---

### **2. Show Through Action**

Instead of stating facts, show characters **doing things** that reveal the information.

<details>
<summary><b>Examples: Action-Based Showing</b></summary>

#### **TELL:**
> Marcus was nervous about the interview.

#### **SHOW:**
> Marcus tugged his tie straight for the third time in as many minutes. His resume crinkled in his sweating palm.

---

#### **TELL:**
> She was a careful driver.

#### **SHOW:**
> She checked her mirrors twice, signaled early, and kept both hands at ten and two even on the empty country road.

---

#### **TELL:**
> He was exhausted.

#### **SHOW:**
> He fumbled his keys twice before getting them in the lock. Coffee could wait till tomorrow. Hell, brushing his teeth could wait. He collapsed onto the couch still wearing his shoes.

</details>

---

### **3. Use Body Language**

Physical reactions reveal emotion more powerfully than naming feelings.

<details>
<summary><b>Examples: Body Language</b></summary>

#### **TELL:**
> Janet was disappointed.

#### **SHOW:**
> Janet's smile didn't reach her eyes. "That's great," she said, and turned to the window.

---

#### **TELL:**
> Tom was attracted to her.

#### **SHOW:**
> Tom found himself standing straighter when she entered the room, and he'd checked his reflection three times that morning.

---

#### **TELL:**
> She was scared.

#### **SHOW:**
> Her pulse hammered in her throat. The shadows seemed darker than they should be, and every creak of the old house pulled her attention.

</details>

---

### **4. Show Through Dialogue & Subtext**

What characters **say** and **don't say** reveals more than narrative telling.

<details>
<summary><b>Examples: Dialogue Showing</b></summary>

#### **TELL:**
> Their marriage was falling apart.

#### **SHOW:**
> "I made dinner," she said.
>
> He grunted, eyes on his phone.
>
> "It's getting cold."
>
> "I'll eat later."
>
> She stared at the empty chair across from her. "You always do."

---

#### **TELL:**
> He was lying.

#### **SHOW:**
> "I was at the office," he said, meeting her eyes for a split second before studying his shoes. "You know, the usual. Spreadsheets."
>
> She'd never known him to describe anything as "the usual."

</details>

---

### **5. Use Specific Details**

Specific, concrete details create pictures; vague generalities tell.

<details>
<summary><b>Examples: Specific vs. Vague</b></summary>

| Vague (Telling) | Specific (Showing) |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| She wore nice clothes | She wore a black pencil skirt and pearls her grandmother left her |
| He drove a fancy car | He drove a Tesla that still smelled like the dealership |
| The dog was big | The dog's head reached her waist, and its paws were the size of her fists |
| It was an old book | The book's spine cracked when opened, and the pages had yellowed to cream |

</details>

## ⚖️ **When to Tell Instead of Show**

**Not everything should be shown!** Strategic telling is essential for:

### **1. Pacing Control**

**TELL when you need to:**
- Move quickly through time
- Summarize unimportant events
- Transition between scenes
- Provide necessary context

**Example:**
> "Three months passed before she heard from him again."

This tells efficiently. Showing three months would bore readers.

---

### **2. Information Dumps (Minimally)**

**TELL when:**
- Backstory is essential but not dramatic
- Technical information is needed
- World-building requires explanation

**Example:**
> "The war had ended five years ago, but the city still bore its scars."

This tells efficiently, then you can show the scars.

---

### **3. Character Interiority**

**Internal thoughts** can tell directly when:
- You need the character's interpretation
- The feeling is complex
- Showing would be unclear

**Example:**
> "She knew, without understanding how, that her mother had lied."

This introspection works as telling.

---

### **4. Transitions**

**TELL for:**
- Time jumps
- Location changes
- Scene breaks

**Example:**
> "By the time they reached Denver, the snow had started."

---

## 📊 **The Show/Tell Balance**

```
SHOW: |████████████████░░░░| 80%
TELL: |████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░| 20%
```

**Good fiction** is roughly 80% showing, 20% telling. The ratio varies by:
- **Genre** — Literary shows more; commercial may tell more
- **Pacing** — Fast scenes tell more; important scenes show more
- **POV** — Deep POV shows more; distant POV can tell more
- **Scene importance** — Critical scenes = show; transitions = tell

---

## 🎨 **Advanced Showing Techniques**

### **1. Implication**

Let readers infer rather than stating directly.

**TELL:**
> "He was poor."

**SHOW:**
> "He'd worn the same shirt three days running, and breakfast was the free samples at the grocery store."

**IMPLY:**
> "The apartment had furniture—a card table, a folding chair, a mattress on the floor. More than that seemed like tempting fate."

---

### **2. Contrast**

Show by contrasting with expectation.

**TELL:**
> "The party was awkward."

**SHOW WITH CONTRAST:**
> "The music was too loud, conversations too quiet. People laughed at the wrong moments and checked their phones like lifelines."

---

### **3. Metaphor and Simile**

Use comparison to show vividly.

**TELL:**
> "She was very thin."

**SHOW:**
> "Her wrists looked like they'd snap if you shook her hand too firmly."

---

### **4. Objective Correlative**

Show internal state through external objects/environment.

**TELL:**
> "He felt trapped in his life."

**SHOW (Objective Correlative):**
> "The office walls were the color of old teeth. The window didn't open. Every day, he wore the same tie."

## ✅ **Showing Checklist**

Use this when revising:

- [ ] **Emotions** shown through physical reactions, not named
- [ ] **Character traits** demonstrated through actions
- [ ] **Descriptions** use specific, sensory details
- [ ] **Atmosphere** created through concrete details
- [ ] **Relationships** revealed through interaction, not statement
- [ ] **Backstory** woven into present action when possible
- [ ] **Necessary telling** is strategic, not lazy
- [ ] **Important scenes** heavily show over tell
- [ ] **Readers** can infer and interpret actively

## 🎯 **Exercise: Convert Tell to Show**

Practice by converting these tells into shows:

1. **TELL:** "The teacher was strict."  
   **YOUR SHOW:**

2. **TELL:** "They had been friends for years."  
   **YOUR SHOW:**

3. **TELL:** "The neighborhood was dangerous."  
   **YOUR SHOW:**

4. **TELL:** "She regretted her decision."  
   **YOUR SHOW:**

<details>
<summary><b>💡 Sample Answers</b></summary>

1. **SHOW:** "Ms. Henderson tapped her ruler against the desk—once for talking, twice for slouching. Three times meant detention, and everyone knew it."

2. **SHOW:** "They finished each other's sentences and shared a look that communicated entire conversations. When one ordered coffee, the other was already adding cream, no sugar, exactly right."

3. **SHOW:** "Glass glittered in the gutters. Every house had bars on the windows, and the liquor store had a security guard who looked like he'd seen things."

4. **SHOW:** "She stared at the empty inbox, cursor blinking where his name should be. Her finger hovered over the keyboard, then fell. Some messages, once sent, couldn't be unsent."
