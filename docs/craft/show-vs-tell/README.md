## 💡 **Key Principles**

### **The Core Truth:**
> **Show the important stuff. Tell the rest.**

### **Essential Guidelines:**

**✨ Show When:**
- Emotional stakes are high
- Character is revealing themselves
- The moment is pivotal
- You want to create suspense
- Readers need to experience, not just know

**⚡ Tell When:**
- Information is necessary but boring
- Time needs to pass
- Pacing is dragging
- You're setting up a showing moment
- Efficiency serves the story

**🎯 Always Ask:**
- Does this moment deserve scene-level attention?
- Am I creating immersion or just explaining?
- Will readers infer this, or do I need to state it?
- Does this advance plot, reveal character, or deepen theme?

## 💭 **Philosophy of Show vs. Tell**

### **It's Not a Rule—It's a Tool**

The "rule" of "show, don't tell" is misunderstood. The truth:

> **Both showing and telling are essential tools. Master writers know when to use each.**

### **Showing:**
- Creates experience
- Immersive and vivid
- Slower, detailed
- Engages readers actively
- More sophisticated

### **Telling:**
- Provides information
- Efficient and clear
- Faster, summarized
- Direct communication
- Equally valid when used well

**The art** is knowing which technique serves each moment best.
