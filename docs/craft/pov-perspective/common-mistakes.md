# ⚠️ Common POV Mistakes

> *"The most common POV mistake isn't choosing the wrong perspective—it's not committing fully to the one you chose."*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

Point of view errors can derail even the most compelling story. These mistakes confuse readers, break immersion, and undermine your narrative authority. This guide covers the most common POV pitfalls and how to avoid them.

---

## 🚫 **The Big Three: Most Common Mistakes**

### **1. Head-Hopping**

**The most common and destructive POV error.**

**What it is:** Jumping between different characters' perspectives within a single scene without clear transitions.

#### **Example (Head-Hopping - Wrong):**

> Sarah slammed the door. She was furious. Marcus flinched. He knew he'd screwed up. Sarah didn't want to hear his excuses. Marcus wished he could explain. She stormed upstairs. He watched her go, feeling helpless.

**Why it's wrong:** Readers whipsaw between Sarah's anger and Marcus's regret within seconds. No clear POV.

#### **Fixed (Third Person Limited - Sarah's POV):**

> Sarah slammed the door, fury radiating through every muscle. Marcus flinched—good. Let him squirm. She didn't want his excuses. Not today. Not ever. She stormed upstairs without looking back. Whatever helpless expression he was making, she didn't want to see it.

**What changed:**
- ✅ Stayed in Sarah's POV throughout
- ✅ Showed Marcus only through Sarah's observations
- ✅ Sarah's emotions direct; Marcus's inferred

#### **Alternative Fix (Third Person Omniscient - Intentional):**

> Sarah slammed the door, consumed by fury. Marcus flinched, guilt washing over him. They stood frozen—two people who loved each other, unable to speak across three feet of distance. Neither knew that this moment would define the next year of their lives. But perhaps they sensed it. Perhaps that's why neither moved.

**What makes this work:**
- ✅ Clear omniscient narrator presence
- ✅ Deliberate, purposeful perspective shifts
- ✅ Narrative voice above the characters
- ✅ Not random head-jumping

---

### **2. Filtering**

**Creating unnecessary distance through filter words.**

**What it is:** Using words like "saw," "heard," "felt," "noticed," "realized" that remind readers of the narrator's presence.

#### **Common Filter Words:**

- 👁️ Visual: saw, watched, looked, noticed, observed, appeared, seemed
- 👂 Auditory: heard, listened to
- 🖐️ Tactile: felt, touched
- 👃 Olfactory: smelled
- 👅 Gustatory: tasted
- 🧠 Mental: thought, wondered, realized, knew, believed, understood, considered, decided

#### **Example (Filtered - Weak):**

> She saw him standing by the window. She heard rain drumming on the glass. She felt her heart race. She thought he looked sad. She realized she still loved him.

**Why it's weak:** Every sentence reminds us of the narrator seeing/hearing/feeling. Creates distance.

#### **Fixed (Unfiltered - Strong):**

> He stood by the window. Rain drummed on the glass. Her heart raced. He looked sad. God. She still loved him.

**What changed:**
- ✅ Direct experience instead of reported experience
- ✅ Faster pacing
- ✅ More immediate
- ✅ Stronger emotional impact

#### **When Filtering is Acceptable:**

✅ **For emphasis:** "I heard it again—that same scratching in the walls."  
✅ **For uncertainty:** "She seemed angry, but something else flickered beneath."  
✅ **For mental processes:** "She decided to leave before he returned."  
✅ **Occasionally for rhythm variation**

**Rule:** Cut filters unless they serve specific purpose.

### **3. Including Information POV Character Doesn't Know**

**Breaking POV by revealing things perspective character couldn't possibly know.**

#### **Example (POV Break - Wrong):**

**In Sarah's POV:**
> Sarah left the apartment and drove to work. Behind her, Marcus sat on the couch, his head in his hands. He'd been planning to propose that morning. The ring was still in his pocket, and he didn't know if he'd ever get another chance.

**Why it's wrong:** Sarah left. She can't see Marcus or know his plans.

#### **Fixed (Maintaining POV - Right):**

**Option 1 - Sarah's POV only:**
> Sarah left the apartment and drove to work. Marcus had looked terrible this morning—pale, stressed. Something was bothering him. He'd tell her eventually. He always did.

**Option 2 - Multiple POV with clear break:**
```
SARAH'S CHAPTER:
Sarah left the apartment and drove to work. Marcus had looked terrible. Something was bothering him.

[CHAPTER BREAK or ***]

MARCUS'S CHAPTER:
Marcus sat on the couch, head in his hands. He'd been planning to propose that morning. The ring was still in his pocket.
```

## 🎯 **Other Common POV Mistakes**

### **4. Inconsistent POV Depth/Distance**

**Varying how close you are to character's thoughts without reason.**

#### **Example (Inconsistent - Wrong):**

> She entered the café nervously. The walls were painted beige. Terror gripped her. The chairs were wooden. She scanned for exits, pulse racing. The menu was on the chalkboard. Her hands trembled.

**Why it's wrong:** Alternates between deep emotional POV (terror, trembling) and distant observation (beige walls, wooden chairs) randomly.

#### **Fixed (Consistent - Right):**

**Distant throughout:**
> She entered the café and sat near the door. The place was small, beige walls and wooden chairs. She ordered coffee and waited, checking her phone every few minutes.

**Close throughout:**
> She entered the café. Beige walls pressed in. Wooden chairs like prison furniture. Where were the exits? There—back corner. Window to the left. Front door behind. Her hands shook around the menu.

**What changed:** Consistent psychic distance. Everything filtered through same level of character consciousness.

---

### **5. POV Character Describing Themselves Unrealistically**

**Character noticing things about themselves they wouldn't naturally observe.**

#### **Example (Unnatural - Wrong):**

**First person:**
> I ran my fingers through my long, auburn hair and gazed at him with my sparkling green eyes. My pouty lips curved into a smile.

**Why it's wrong:** 
- People don't think about their own features this way
- Sounds like reading a character sheet
- No one thinks "my pouty lips"

#### **Fixed (Natural - Right):**

**Option 1 - Use another character:**
> "You have incredible eyes," he said.
> I blinked. "They're just green."
> "Not just green." He leaned closer. "Green with gold flecks. I noticed the first time I met you."

**Option 2 - Use mirrors/reflections naturally:**
> I caught my reflection in the window. When had I last brushed my hair? I tucked the mess behind my ears.

**Option 3 - Compare or contrast:**
> I'd inherited Dad's height but Mom's coloring. While my sister got the good hair, I got the stubborn cowlick that refused to stay flat.

**Option 4 - Skip it:**
> Physical appearance often doesn't matter as much as you think. Focus on character voice and behavior.

---

### **6. Telling Thoughts You're Already Inside Of**

**Using thought tags when already in character's head.**

#### **Example (Redundant - Wrong):**

**In first person:**
> I thought about what she'd said. I wondered if she was right. I realized I'd been wrong all along. I knew I had to apologize.

**Why it's wrong:** We're already in "I's" head. "I thought/wondered/realized/knew" is redundant.

#### **Fixed (Direct - Right):**

> What she'd said circled my mind. Was she right? God. I'd been wrong all along. I had to apologize.

**Or:**

> She was right. I'd been wrong all along. I had to apologize.

---

### **7. Character Stating Obvious Emotions**

**Character naming their own emotions instead of experiencing them.**

#### **Example (Telling - Weak):**

> I was angry. I was so angry I could barely think. My anger consumed me.

**Why it's weak:** Telling emotion rather than showing it. Distance between reader and experience.

#### **Fixed (Showing - Strong):**

> Heat flooded my face. My fists clenched. I couldn't speak—couldn't trust myself not to scream.

**Or (Deep POV):**

> Hit him. I could hit him. Should hit him. Fist through that smug face. Consequences later. Satisfaction now. My fist clenched.

---

### **8. Breaking First Person**

**Slipping out of "I" into third person.**

#### **Example (POV Break - Wrong):**

> I walked into the room. Sarah turned around. Her face lit up when she saw me. I smiled back.

**Why it's wrong:** "Her face lit up when she saw me" is observer narration, not first person experience.

#### **Fixed (Consistent First - Right):**

> I walked into the room. Sarah turned around. Her face—god, that smile. My chest tightened. I smiled back.

**Or:**

> I walked into the room. "You came!" Sarah's face lit up. Made my whole day worth it.

---

### **9. Omniscient Narrator Pretending to Be Limited**

**Omniscient narrator suddenly restricting information artificially.**

#### **Example (Inconsistent - Wrong):**

**In omniscient POV throughout book, suddenly:**
> Marcus opened the envelope. Inside was... something. Something important. But we don't need to know what yet. Let's check on Sarah instead.

**Why it's wrong:** Omniscient narrator has been showing everything; suddenly coy withholding feels manipulative.

**Better:**
- **Stay omniscient:** Show what's in the envelope but reveal why it matters later
- **Or switch to limited:** Clearly move to third limited for this section
- **Or own it:** "What he read in that letter would change everything. But let's leave him with his discovery for a moment..."

---

### **10. Second Person Dictating Internal States**

**Telling reader what "you" think/feel when they might not.**

#### **Example (Presumptuous - Wrong):**

> You've always been afraid of spiders. Your heart races when you see one. You can't help it.

**Problem:** Reader who isn't afraid of spiders rejects the narrative.

#### **Fixed (Universal or Observational - Right):**

**Option 1 - Observable behavior:**
> You see the spider. Your heart rate spikes. Is that normal? Probably. Everyone reacts to spiders. Right?

**Option 2 - Make it specific character in second person:**
> You've been afraid of spiders since childhood. That summer at camp. The web across your face in the dark cabin. You still check corners.

**Option 3 - Use first person instead:**
> I've always been afraid of spiders. My heart races when I see one. I can't help it.

## 🔧 **How to Fix POV Problems**

### **Step 1: Identify Your POV**

**Ask yourself:**
- Whose story is this?
- What POV did I choose? (First? Third limited? Omniscient?)
- Am I sticking to it?

---

### **Step 2: Read Aloud**

**POV errors often "sound" wrong even if they look right.**

**Listen for:**
- Whose voice are you hearing?
- Whose head are you in?
- Does it shift unexpectedly?

---

### **Step 3: Track POV Through Scene**

**Method: Highlight different colors for different POVs.**

- 🟦 Blue = Character A
- 🟩 Green = Character B
- 🟥 Red = Information neither character knows
- 🟨 Yellow = Omniscient narrator

If you see unexpected color changes, you've found a POV problem.

---

### **Step 4: Cut Filter Words**

**Search your manuscript for:**
- saw, heard, felt, noticed, watched
- thought, realized, wondered, knew

**Delete or rewrite** 80% of them.

---

### **Step 5: Test Each Sentence**

**For each sentence, ask:**
- Could my POV character know this?
- Would they think about it this way?
- Am I in their head or observing from outside?

---

## 📊 **POV Decision Tree**

**When unsure if something breaks POV, ask:**

```
1. Whose POV am I in right now?
   ↓
2. Could this character know/see/hear this?
   ├─ YES → Proceed
   └─ NO → Cut or reveal how they learned it
   ↓
3. Would this character think about it this way?
   ├─ YES → Keep it
   └─ NO → Rewrite in their voice
   ↓
4. Am I filtering unnecessarily?
   ├─ NO → Good
   └─ YES → Remove filter words
   ↓

## ✍️ **Practice Exercises**

### **Exercise 1: Spot the Head-Hop**

Read published books in your genre. Find a head-hop (they exist even in published work!). Rewrite the passage to fix it.

---

### **Exercise 2: De-Filter Your Work**

Take a chapter you've written. Highlight all filter words. Rewrite without them. Compare before and after.

---

### **Exercise 3: POV Consistency Check**

Take one scene. Identify whose POV it's in. Read every sentence and ask: "Could this character know this?" Mark any violations.

---

### **Exercise 4: Intentional Omniscient**

Take a head-hopping scene you've written. Rewrite it as intentional third person omniscient with clear narrator voice. Notice the difference.

## 💡 **Final Thoughts**

**Remember:**

1. **POV is a promise to your reader.** Once established, stick to it.

2. **POV errors confuse readers.** Confused readers stop reading.

3. **The best POV is invisible.** Readers shouldn't notice technique—only story.

4. **Master one POV before attempting complex structures.** Walk before running.

5. **Revision is where you fix POV.** First draft = get story down. Second draft = nail POV consistency.

6. **Read in your chosen POV.** Study published books. See how masters handle it.

7. **When in doubt, simplify.** Most problems come from trying to show too much. Limit perspective, gain clarity.

*POV is the lens through which readers experience your story. Keep it clean, clear, and consistent, and your readers will stay immersed from first page to last.*
