# 👁️ Third Person Limited POV

> *"Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways."* — J.K. Rowling, *Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone*

---

## 📖 **What is Third Person Limited?**

**Third person limited** (also called "close third" or "third person subjective") uses "he/she/they" pronouns while staying inside one character's perspective at a time. The reader sees the world through that character's eyes and knows their thoughts, but maintains slight narrative distance.

### **Key Characteristics:**
- 👁️ **He/she/they pronouns:** External narrator
- 💭 **Single perspective:** One character's viewpoint per scene/chapter
- 🔒 **Limited knowledge:** Only what POV character knows
- 🎭 **Internal access:** Thoughts and feelings available
- 📏 **Some distance:** Not as intimate as first person

### **The Golden Rule:**
> "Third limited gives you the intimacy of first person with the flexibility of third person—best of both worlds."

---

## ✨ **Strengths of Third Person Limited**

### **1. Balance of Intimacy and Distance**

Third limited lets readers connect deeply with characters while maintaining narrative breathing room.

**Example:**
> Sarah pressed her palm against the door. Inside, she heard footsteps. Her hand trembled—not from cold, but from certainty. Everything would change the moment she knocked.

**Why it works:** Close to character's experience but with slight narrative perspective.

---

### **2. Flexibility with Multiple Characters**

Can shift POV between chapters or sections to show different perspectives.

**Example:**
> **Chapter 1 - Marcus**
> Marcus watched her leave. He wanted to call after her, to explain. But the words stuck in his throat like glass.
>
> **Chapter 2 - Elena**
> Elena didn't look back. If she did, she'd see him standing there, and she might weaken. She couldn't afford to weaken.

**Why it works:** Each character gets their moment as protagonist.

---

### **3. Easier to Write Than First Person**

"He thought" vs. "I thought"—less demanding than maintaining first person voice.

**Example (easier in third):**
> He considered his options. Lying would be easier. But Sarah would know. She always knew.

**Same in first (requires stronger voice):**
> I considered my options. Lying would be easier. But Sarah would know. She always knew.

---

### **4. Reader Sympathy Without Full Investment**

Readers can understand and care without fully *being* the character.

**Example:**
> Tom was wrong. He knew it even as he said it, but pride wouldn't let him back down. He watched her face close off, shuttering like a house in a storm, and hated himself for it.

**Effect:** Readers see Tom's flaws clearly while still sympathizing.

---

## ⚡ **Types of Third Person Limited**

### **Third Limited Close**

Nearly as intimate as first person, deep in character's head.

**Example:**
> The phone rang. Sarah's heart jumped. Marcus. It had to be Marcus. She reached for it, hand shaking. Don't be desperate, she told herself. Play it cool. But her finger hit answer before she could think.

**Characteristics:**
- Deep access to thoughts
- Character's vocabulary and voice color the narration
- Minimal narrative distance
- Borders on [Deep POV](deep-pov.md)

---

### **Third Limited Distant**

More camera-like, focuses on external observations with some internal access.

**Example:**
> The phone rang. Sarah picked it up on the second ring, her expression carefully neutral. She listened, said nothing for a long moment, then set the phone down without a word.

**Characteristics:**
- More external observation
- Less direct thought access
- Slight narrator presence
- Approaches third omniscient

---

### **The Spectrum:**

```
First Person → Deep POV → Close Third Limited → Distant Third Limited → Third Omniscient
[Most Intimate] ←————————————————————————————————————————————→ [Most Distance]
```

---

## 🎯 **Handling Thoughts in Third Limited**

### **Method 1: Direct Thought (Most Common)**

**Present thoughts without tags or italics.**

**Example:**
> She stared at the email. He was lying. Had to be. No one resigned from a job like that without a reason.

**Best for:** Seamless integration, modern style

---

### **Method 2: Italicized Direct Thought**

**Like dialogue, but internal.**

**Example:**
> She stared at the email. *He's lying,* she thought. *Has to be. No one resigns from a job like that without a reason.*

**Best for:** Emphasizing internal voice, distinguishing from narrative

---

### **Method 3: Indirect Thought**

**Filter through narrative voice.**

**Example:**
> She stared at the email. He was lying, she thought. Had to be. No one resigned from a job like that without a reason.

**Best for:** Maintaining distance, older literary style

---

### **Method 4: Free Indirect Discourse**

**Thought and narrative blur together.**

**Example:**
> She stared at the email. Lying. Obviously. Who resigned from a job like that without a reason? Please.

**Best for:** Sophisticated literary fiction, character voice infusing narration

---

## ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**

### **1. Head-Hopping**

**Problem:** Switching POV within a scene without clear transition.

**Wrong:**
> Sarah slammed the door. She was furious. Marcus flinched. He knew he'd screwed up. Sarah didn't care about his excuses anymore. Marcus wished he could explain.

**Why it's wrong:** Jumps between Sarah's and Marcus's perspectives mid-scene.

**Right:**
> Sarah slammed the door, fury radiating from her rigid shoulders. Marcus flinched. She didn't look back, didn't give him a chance to explain. Not that he deserved one.

**Fix:** Stay in one head. Show other character through observation only.

---

### **2. Inconsistent Depth**

**Problem:** Varying how deeply you're in the character's head without reason.

**Inconsistent:**
> She entered the room cautiously. The wallpaper was striped. Terror gripped her heart. The carpet was beige.

**Why it's wrong:** Mixing deep emotion with detached observation randomly.

**Consistent:**
> She entered the room cautiously, every nerve alert. Striped wallpaper closed in like prison bars. Beige carpet muffled her footsteps—no warning when someone approached.

**Fix:** Filter everything through character's emotional/mental state.

---

### **3. Thought Tags Everywhere**

**Problem:** "He thought," "she wondered," "he realized" becomes repetitive.

**Weak:**
> He thought about what she'd said. He wondered if she was right. He realized he'd been wrong.

**Strong:**
> What she'd said circled his mind like a vulture. Was she right? God. He'd been wrong all along.

**Fix:** Establish POV clearly, then drop tags except for clarity.

---

### **4. Filtering**

**Problem:** Unnecessary distance words.

**Weak:**
> She saw him enter. She heard the door close. She felt her heart race.

**Strong:**
> He entered. The door closed. Her heart raced.

**Fix:** We're in her POV—we already know she's seeing, hearing, feeling.

---

## 📚 **Third Person Limited in Practice**

### **Strong Opening:**

> "Harry Potter was a highly unusual boy in many ways. For one thing, he hated the summer holidays more than any other time of year. For another, he really wanted to do his homework but was forced to do it in secret, in the dead of night." — J.K. Rowling

**Why it works:** Establishes third person while clearly tied to Harry's perspective.

---

### **Action Scenes:**

**Example:**
> The first punch came from the left. Marcus ducked—barely. His shoulder clipped the wall. Pain shot down his arm. No time. The second punch was already coming. He threw himself sideways, slipping on broken glass. His hand found something heavy. A bottle. Not much, but it would do.

**Key:** Fast pacing, action filtered through POV character's experience.

---

### **Emotional Scenes:**

**Example:**
> She held the letter in both hands. Her mother's handwriting—shaky now, uncertain. *My dear Emma.* That's all it took. Three words, and twenty years of silence cracked open like an egg. She sat down before her legs gave out.

**Key:** Deep emotional access while maintaining third person perspective.

---

### **Dialogue:**

**In third limited, dialogue tags can show POV subtly:**

**Example:**
> "I'm fine," Sarah lied.
> "Sure you are," he said, not believing her for a second.

**vs.**

> "I'm fine," Sarah said.
> "Sure you are," Marcus said, his voice dripping with skepticism.

**First shows Sarah's POV (she knows she's lying).**  
**Second could be either POV (external observation).**

---

## 🎨 **Advanced Techniques**

### **Character Voice Coloring Narrative**

Let POV character's personality infuse the prose itself.

**Example (Cynical character):**
> The office Christmas party. Because nothing said "holiday cheer" like forced fun with people you barely tolerated fifty weeks a year. Sarah grabbed a cookie that probably cost less than the memo announcing cutbacks.

**Example (Optimistic character):**
> The office Christmas party! Twinkling lights, cookies, laughter—Sarah loved seeing everyone relaxed for once. Even grumpy Dan from Accounting was smiling.

**Same event, different POV characters, different narrative tone.**

---

### **Psychic Distance**

Control how close or far you are from the character's consciousness.

**Far:**
> The woman entered the room.

**Medium-Far:**
> Sarah entered the room carefully.

**Medium:**
> Sarah entered the room, immediately scanning for exits.

**Close:**
> Sarah entered the room. Where were the exits? Windows, door—one, two. She catalogued them automatically, old habits from therapy she pretended had worked.

**Very Close (Deep POV):**
> The room. Exits? Windows—one, two. Door. Catalogue them, mark them, file them away. Habits from therapy she told everyone had worked.

## 💡 **Best Practices**

### **Do:**
- ✅ **Choose ONE POV character** per scene (usually)
- ✅ **Stay consistent** in depth throughout scene
- ✅ **Filter sensory details** through POV character's attention
- ✅ **Use character's vocabulary** in narration
- ✅ **Show other characters** through observation
- ✅ **Make POV shifts clear** (new chapter, scene break, etc.)

### **Don't:**
- ❌ **Head-hop** without clear breaks
- ❌ **Include information** POV character doesn't know
- ❌ **Use omniscient narrator voice** if you've chosen limited
- ❌ **Over-use thought tags** ("he thought," "she wondered")
- ❌ **Filter unnecessarily** ("he saw," "she heard")
- ❌ **Forget whose POV** you're in mid-scene

---

## 🎯 **When to Use Third Person Limited**

### **Ideal For:**
- ✅ **Multiple POV characters** (alternating chapters)
- ✅ **Character-driven stories** needing intimacy
- ✅ **Most contemporary fiction**
- ✅ **When you want intimacy with flexibility**
- ✅ **Young adult and middle grade** (expected norm)
- ✅ **Readers who find first person too intense**

### **Less Ideal For:**
- ❌ Sweeping epics needing omniscient narrator
- ❌ Stories requiring maximum intimacy (use first or deep POV)
- ❌ Stories needing complete external objectivity
- ❌ Experimental fiction breaking conventions

### **Classic Third Limited:**
- *Harry Potter* series by J.K. Rowling (Harry's POV throughout)
- *The Lord of the Rings* by J.R.R. Tolkien (shifts between characters)
- *The Hunger Games* series (wait—this is first person! But would work in third limited)

### **Modern Third Limited:**
- *All the Light We Cannot See* by Anthony Doerr (alternating POVs)
- *The Night Circus* by Erin Morgenstern
- *Six of Crows* by Leigh Bardugo (multiple POV characters)

### **Close/Deep Third:**
- Much of literary fiction
- Psychological thrillers
- Character studies

---

## ✍️ **Practice Exercise**

### **Exercise 1: Same Scene, Different POVs**

Write the same scene from two different characters' third-person-limited perspectives:
- A job interview: applicant vs. interviewer
- A first date: both people
- An argument: both sides

Notice how facts stay the same but story changes completely.

---

### **Exercise 2: Psychic Distance Ladder**

Take one moment. Write it at five different psychic distances from far to very close. Notice how each version reveals different information and creates different effects.

---

### **Exercise 3: No Filtering**

Rewrite a passage, removing all filtering words:
- "She saw..."
- "He heard..."
- "She noticed..."
- "He felt..."

Notice how prose becomes more immediate.
