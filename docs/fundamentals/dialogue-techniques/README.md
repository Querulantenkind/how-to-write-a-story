> *Mastering the art of conversation: creating authentic, powerful dialogue that reveals character and drives story*

## 📖 **Welcome to Dialogue Techniques**

Dialogue is one of the most powerful tools in fiction writing. When done well, it reveals character, creates conflict, conveys information, and advances plot—all while sounding natural and effortless. This section provides comprehensive guides to help you master every aspect of writing compelling dialogue.

**Great dialogue** is not transcribed real speech—it's the illusion of real speech, carefully crafted to serve your story while maintaining authenticity.

## 🎨 **Core Principles**

### **1. Good Dialogue Is Purposeful**

Every line should accomplish multiple functions:
- ✅ Reveals character
- ✅ Advances plot
- ✅ Creates conflict
- ✅ Conveys information
- ✅ Shows relationships
- ✅ Builds tension

**Not just:** "Nice weather today."  
**But:** "Nice weather for a funeral."

*Reveals character attitude, situation, tone*

---

### **2. Natural ≠ Real**

**Real Conversation:**
> "Um, so, like, I was thinking, you know, maybe we could, uh, possibly go to dinner or something, if you want, I mean, only if you're free, but like, no pressure or anything..."

**Fiction Dialogue:**
> "Dinner tonight?"

*Fiction dialogue is real speech condensed and purposeful*

---

### **3. Character Voice Matters**

Each character should sound distinct:

**Professor:**
> "The hypothesis requires additional empirical evidence before we can draw conclusions."

**Mechanic:**
> "We need to test this thing before we know if it works."

**Teenager:**
> "We should totally try it first."

*Same meaning, three voices*

**See: [Dialogue Fundamentals](fundamentals.md)**

---

### **4. Subtext Creates Depth**

What's said vs. what's meant:

**Surface:**
> "Fine."

**Subtext:**
> "I'm not fine. I'm angry/hurt/upset, but I don't want to talk about it."

**In Context:**
> "Are you okay?"  
> "Fine." She turned away.

*Body language confirms subtext*

**See: [Subtext](subtext.md)**

---

### **5. "Said" Is Your Friend**

The best dialogue tags are invisible:

**❌ Don't:**
> "I love you," he professed ardently.  
> "Do you?" she queried dubiously.

**✅ Do:**
> "I love you," he said.  
> "Do you?"

*Simple tags disappear; readers focus on dialogue*

**See: [Dialogue Tags](dialogue-tags.md)**

<summary><b>🎭 Distinctive Character Voices</b></summary>

<summary><b>💭 Mastering Subtext</b></summary>

**What Is It:**
Unspoken meaning beneath dialogue

**Techniques:**
- Say the opposite
- Use silence
- Change the subject
- Minimal responses
- Body language contradicts words

**Example:**
> "I don't care what he thinks."  
> "Then why are you asking?"

*Says doesn't care, clearly cares*

**Types:**
- Emotional subtext
- Intentional subtext
- Power dynamics
- Historical baggage
- Self-deception

**Deep Dive:** [Subtext](subtext.md)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🏷️ Invisible Attribution</b></summary>

**Three Methods:**
1. Dialogue tags ("said/asked")
2. Action beats (physical actions)
3. No tag/beat (clear from context)

**The 80/20 Rule:**
- 80% should be "said" or "asked"
- 20% can be alternatives or beats

**Example:**
> "I need to tell you something," Sarah said.  
> Tom set down his coffee. "What?"  
> "It's about your brother."  
> "What about him?"  
> "He's been lying." She paused. "For years."

*Mix of tags, beats, no attribution*
