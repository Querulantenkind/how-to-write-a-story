# 🎯 Motivation & Goals

> *What drives your characters: the engine of story and the heart of conflict*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

**Motivation** is the **why** behind everything your characters do. It's the driving force that propels them through the story, makes their choices believable, and creates the foundation for compelling conflict. Without clear motivation, characters feel hollow and their actions arbitrary.

### **Why Motivation Matters:**
- ⚡ **Drives Plot:** Motivated characters create story through action
- 🎯 **Creates Conflict:** Competing motivations = drama
- 💖 **Builds Empathy:** Understanding why makes us care
- ✅ **Ensures Consistency:** Motivation guides authentic choices
- 🎭 **Reveals Character:** What they want shows who they are

### **The Golden Rule:**
> "Every character is the hero of their own story."  
> — Everyone has reasons for what they do, even villains

---

## 🎯 **Want vs. Need: The Core Duality**

The most powerful character motivations involve **two goals in conflict**:

Climax: Must have NEED to achieve WANT
End: Gets NEED (and maybe WANT)
```

**Want:** Survive the Hunger Games
**Need:** Learn to trust and love

**Conflict:** 
- Survival requires emotional armor
