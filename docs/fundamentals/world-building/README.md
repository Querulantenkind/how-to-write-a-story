## 💡 **Core Principles**

### **1. The Iceberg Principle**

> Know 90%, show 10%

**Build Deep:**
- Develop extensive world knowledge
- Understand how everything connects
- Know more than readers will see

**Show Sparingly:**
- Reveal only what serves story
- Trust readers to infer
- Avoid info-dumps

**See:** [World-Building Basics](world-building-basics.md)

---

### **2. Serve the Story**

> World-building enables narrative, not replaces it

**Good World-Building:**
- ✅ Creates conflict
- ✅ Shapes character
- ✅ Affects plot
- ✅ Enhances theme
- ✅ Grounds reader

**Bad World-Building:**
- ❌ Exists for its own sake
- ❌ Stops narrative flow
- ❌ Doesn't affect story
- ❌ Overwhelms character
- ❌ Confuses reader

---

### **3. Consistency Is Key**

> Establish rules, then follow them

**Be Consistent With:**
- Magic/technology capabilities
- Geographic relationships
- Cultural practices
- Historical timeline
- Character knowledge

**Tools:**
- World bible/reference document
- Maps and timelines
- Character notes
- Contradiction checks

---

### **4. Show, Don't Tell**

> Reveal through experience, not exposition

**Effective Techniques:**
- Character assumptions
- Conflict-based reveals
- Sensory details
- Dialogue and idioms
- Actions and reactions

**Avoid:**
- Textbook explanations
- Info-dump passages
- Guidebook descriptions
- Lecture-style reveals

**See:** Integration sections in all guides

---

### **5. Think Through Implications**

> Every element affects everything else

**Ask "What If" Questions:**
- If magic exists, how does it change warfare?
- If teleportation is possible, why have roads?
- If dragons are real, how do they affect ecology?
- If this resource is scarce, what conflicts arise?

**Create Ripple Effects:**
One change affects:
→ Technology/Magic
→ Economy
→ Social Structure
→ Daily Life
→ Politics
→ Culture
