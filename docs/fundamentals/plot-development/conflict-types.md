# ⚡ Conflict Types

> *The engine of drama: understanding the forces that drive your story*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

**Conflict** is the opposition between forces—the fundamental ingredient that makes stories compelling. Without conflict, there is no story. Conflict creates tension, reveals character, drives plot forward, and delivers meaning. Understanding the different types of conflict allows you to craft richer, more layered narratives.

### **Why Conflict Matters:**
- 🎭 **Creates Drama:** Source of all tension
- 💡 **Reveals Character:** Shows who people really are
- ⚡ **Drives Plot:** Forces action and change
- 🎯 **Engages Readers:** Creates investment
- 🌟 **Embodies Theme:** Represents story's ideas

### **The Golden Rule:**
> "Conflict is not arguments or fights—it's opposition. Any time a character wants something and something stands in their way, you have conflict."  
> — The best stories layer multiple types of conflict
