### **1. Surprising:**

**The twist must shock:**
- Readers didn't predict it
- Defies expectations
- "I didn't see that coming!"
- Fresh and unexpected

**But Not Random:**
- Still makes logical sense
- Clues were present
- Feels organic, not forced

---

### **2. Inevitable:**

**Looking back, it should feel meant to be:**
- "Oh, of course!"
- "It was there all along!"
- Clues make sense now
- Pieces fit together

**The Recontextualization:**
Everything you thought you knew means something different now

**Example — *The Sixth Sense*:**
> **Twist:** Bruce Willis is dead  
> **Rewatch:** Every scene makes perfect sense—he never interacts with others, sits alone, wife ignores him

---

### **3. Earned:**

**Properly set up:**
- Clues planted throughout
- Foreshadowing present
- Not pulled from nowhere
- Fair to the reader

**The "Fair Play" Rule:**
Reader had all information needed to figure it out (but probably didn't)

---

### **4. Meaningful:**

**Must matter to story:**
- Changes our understanding
- Affects character journey
- Serves theme
- Raises stakes or complicates situation

**Not just surprising for its own sake**
