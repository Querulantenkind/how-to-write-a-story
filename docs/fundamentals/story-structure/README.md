## 🎓 **Advanced Structure Concepts**

<details>
<summary><b>🔍 Nested Structures</b></summary>

**Concept:** Stories within stories, each with its own structure

**Applications:**
- **Chapter Structure** — Mini three-act within each chapter
- **Scene Structure** — Each scene has beginning/middle/end
- **Subplot Structure** — Secondary plots follow their own arcs
- **Series Structure** — Each book follows structure, series follows meta-structure

**Example:** *The Lord of the Rings* — Each book has structure, trilogy has structure, individual chapters have structure

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🔀 Non-Linear Structures</b></summary>

**Concept:** Story told out of chronological order

**Still needs structure:**
- Emotional arc must build
- Revelations must pace correctly
- Ending must satisfy

**Examples:** *Pulp Fiction*, *Arrival*, *The Time Traveler's Wife*

**Note:** Even non-linear stories follow emotional structure

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>🎭 Multiple Protagonists</b></summary>

**Concept:** Several characters' arcs interweaving

**Approach:**
- Each protagonist follows individual arc
- Arcs intersect at key points
- Overall story has meta-structure
- Often uses braiding technique

**Examples:** *Game of Thrones*, *Cloud Atlas*, ensemble films

</details>
