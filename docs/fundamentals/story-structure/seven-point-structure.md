## ✅ **How to Use the Seven-Point Structure**

### **Planning Your Story:**

**1. Start with Resolution:**
- Where will your protagonist end up?
- What will they become?
- How will they be different?

**2. Define the Hook:**
- What's the opposite of Resolution?
- What weakness/flaw do they start with?
- Where are they "before"?

**3. Identify Midpoint:**
- What shifts them from reactive to active?
- What revelation or power-up?
- How do they change approach?

**4. Determine Plot Turns:**
- **Plot Turn 1:** What forces them into story?
- **Plot Turn 2:** What gives them solution?

**5. Create Pinches:**
- **Pinch 1:** How does antagonist apply pressure?
- **Pinch 2:** What's the "all is lost" moment?

**6. Fill in Between:**
- Scenes that connect the points
- Character development moments
- Subplots and relationships

### **For Pantsers (Discovery Writers):**

Use Seven-Point Structure in **revision**:

1. Identify where these points naturally occurred
2. Strengthen weak points
3. Ensure character transformation is clear
4. Verify protagonist shifts at midpoint
5. Check that Resolution mirrors Hook

### **For Plotters (Outliners):**

1. Fill out Seven Points first
2. Expand each point into scenes
3. Add connecting tissue
4. Ensure smooth transitions
