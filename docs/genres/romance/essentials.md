## 📖 **What is Romance?**

**Romance fiction** is a genre centered on **the development of a romantic relationship** between two (or more) people, with the expectation of an **emotionally satisfying and optimistic ending**.

**Core Requirements:**
1. **Central love story** — Romance is the main plot
2. **Emotional journey** — Focus on feelings and relationship
3. **Satisfying ending** — HEA (Happily Ever After) or HFN (Happy For Now)

---

## 💖 **Essential Romance Elements**

### **1. The Central Relationship**

Romance is THE plot, not a subplot.

**Requirements:**
- Romantic relationship drives story
- Most page time devoted to romance
- Conflicts center on relationship
- Resolution is about couple
- Both characters have agency

**Not Romance:**
If you can remove the love story and still have a complete plot, it's not romance genre—it's a story with romantic elements.

---

### **2. The Meet-Cute**

How the couple first encounters each other.

**Characteristics:**
- Memorable first meeting
- Often awkward or antagonistic
- Sets up relationship dynamic

- Creates spark (or friction)

**Examples:**

- Awkward mishap
- Wrong place, wrong time
- Mistaken identity
- Rescue/damsel situation
- Workplace encounter

**Purpose:** Hook readers on the pairing early.

---

### **3. Romantic Tension**

The "will they, won't they" factor.

**Creating Tension:**
- **Obstacles** — What keeps them apart?
- **Misunderstandings** — Communication fails
- **External barriers** — Circumstances prevent relationship
- **Internal barriers** — Personal fears/issues
- **Attraction vs. resistance** — Want each other but can't admit it

**Balancing Act:**
Enough obstacles to create tension, not so many it's frustrating.

---

### **4. Character Chemistry**

That indefinable spark.

**Elements of Chemistry:**

- **Emotional connection** — Understanding each other
- **Shared values** — Compatible worldviews

Darkest hour when all seems lost.

**What Happens:**
