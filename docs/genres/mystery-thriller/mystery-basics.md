## 🔎 **Writing Mystery**

### **Work Backward**

Know the solution first.

**Planning Process:**
1. **Decide who, why, how** — The truth
2. **Plant clues** — What detective finds
3. **Create red herrings** — False leads
4. **Timeline** — When things happened
5. **Alibis and motives** — For all suspects
6. **Discovery order** — How clues are revealed

**Why:** Can't plant clues if you don't know solution.

---

### **The Fair Play Principle**

Reader should be able to solve it.

**Requirements:**
- All clues available to reader
- Detective doesn't withhold info
- Solution uses established facts
- No secret passages unknown to reader
- No undisclosed supernatural powers
- Culprit introduced early

**Golden Age Standard:**
Some readers want to solve it; play fair.

---

### **Planting Clues**

Make them visible but not obvious.

**Techniques:**
- **Bury in description** — Mentioned casually
- **Misdirection** — Attention elsewhere
- **Multiple clues** — Some false, some real
- **Early placement** — Before significance clear
- **Character distraction** — Detective doesn't notice yet

**Example:**
```
"The study smelled of leather and pipe tobacco. 
The desk was neat—too neat, perhaps. A single photo 
frame faced away from the desk chair. Everything else 
squared off perfectly, except the carpet, rucked up 
near the safe."

Hidden clues: Frame orientation, carpet disturbance = safe opened recently
```

---

### **Red Herrings**

False leads that mislead.

**Purpose:**
- Increase difficulty
- Surprise reader
- Create suspense
- Make solution less obvious

**Balance:**
- Fair but misleading
- Explained later
- Don't overwhelm real clues
- Plausible at the time

**Example:**
Character with secret (affair, debt) that looks suspicious but isn't the murder.

---

Give each motive and opportunity.

**For Each Suspect:**
- **Motive** — Why they'd do it
- **Opportunity** — Could they have?

- **Secret** — Something hidden
- **Alibi** — Where they claim to be

**Classic Number:** 5-8 suspects ideal.

---

**Use:** Creates false leads naturally.

---

One crucial detail withheld.
