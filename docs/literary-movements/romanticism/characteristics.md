## 📖 **Overview**

Romantic literature is immediately recognizable through its **emotional intensity, celebration of individualism, and reverence for nature**. This guide breaks down the specific characteristics that define the movement.

## ✨ **Core Characteristics**

### **1. Emphasis on Emotion and Intuition**

**Definition:** Feelings and instincts valued over rational thought.

**In Literature:**

- Emotional reactions described in detail

- Inner feelings as plot drivers

**Example Techniques:**

Romantic: "A wild, uncontrollable joy surged through her veins, 
drowning all reason, all propriety, all doubt."

Non-romantic: "She felt happy about the decision."
```

**Modern Application:**

spire—a reminder that beyond the petty concerns of men, 
something vast and incomprehensible endured."
