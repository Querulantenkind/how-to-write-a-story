## 📖 **What is Romanticism?**

**Romanticism** (roughly 1780-1850) was a revolutionary artistic and intellectual movement that **rejected Enlightenment rationalism** in favor of emotion, imagination, and individual experience. It fundamentally changed how we think about creativity and self-expression.

**Core Belief:** Emotion and intuition are as valid—or more valid—than cold reason for understanding truth and beauty.
