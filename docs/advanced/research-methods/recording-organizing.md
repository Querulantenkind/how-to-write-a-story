# 📝 Recording and Organizing Research

> *Keeping track of what you learn so you can actually use it*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

You've done the research. Now you need to:
1. **Remember** what you learned
2. **Find** it when you need it
3. **Cite** sources if necessary
4. **Apply** it to your writing

Good organization transforms research from overwhelming chaos into a useful resource.

---

## 🎯 **Goals of Research Organization**

### **Your System Should:**

✅ **Be searchable:** Find specific facts quickly
✅ **Be categorized:** Group related information
✅ **Include sources:** Track where information came from
✅ **Be accessible:** Available when writing
✅ **Be sustainable:** Not too complex to maintain

### **Your System Should NOT:**

❌ Be so complex you never update it
❌ Duplicate information unnecessarily
❌ Lose context of where info came from
❌ Mix reliable and unreliable sources
❌ Become procrastination tool itself

## 🔍 **Making Research Findable**

### **Tagging System:**

**Type Tags:**
- `#fact` `#quote` `#statistic` `#anecdote`

**Topic Tags:**
- `#setting` `#character` `#plot` `#historical` `#technical`

**Chapter Tags:**
- `#ch1` `#ch2` `#act1` `#midpoint`

**Source Tags:**
- `#verified` `#needscheck` `#primarysource`

**Example:**
> "Victorian women's skirts weighed 10-15 pounds #fact #setting #fashion #ch2 #verified"

---

### **Search Strategies:**

**Use Keywords:**
Not just topic, but related terms
- "Police" → also tag "detective," "law enforcement," "investigation"

**Date Your Notes:**
Track when you researched (some info goes stale)

**Link Related Notes:**
"See also: [Police Procedure note]"

---

## ✅ **Research Workflow**

### **While Researching:**

1. **Capture:** Take notes in chosen system
2. **Cite:** Record source immediately
3. **Tag:** Add relevant tags/categories
4. **Reflect:** Note why this matters to story

### **Transferring to Research Bible:**

**Weekly/Monthly:**
- Review all notes
- Add key facts to research bible
- Discard irrelevant information
- Consolidate duplicates

### **While Writing:**

**Keep Open:**
- Research bible
- Current chapter research
- Key source documents

**Mark Gaps:**
```
She walked through the [RESEARCH: Victorian train station description] 
and approached the [RESEARCH: what was ticketing process?].
```

**Update As You Go:**
- Note new questions that arise
- Flag facts you use (so you remember source)

---

## 🗑️ **When to Discard Research**

### **Delete/Archive If:**

- ❌ Interesting but irrelevant to story
- ❌ Contradicted by better sources
- ❌ Too detailed for your needs
- ❌ From unreliable source
- ❌ Outdated information

### **Keep If:**

- ✅ Directly relevant to plot/character
- ✅ Helps establish setting
- ✅ Needed for consistency
- ✅ Might use in revision
- ✅ Hard to find again

**Rule of Thumb:**
> "If you haven't referenced it by second draft, you probably won't. Archive it."

---

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **1. Review Regularly**
Don't let research pile up unsorted. Schedule weekly review sessions.

### **2. One System, Consistently**
Pick one system and stick with it. Switching mid-project creates chaos.

### **3. Include Context**
Don't just copy facts—note why they matter to your story.

### **4. Visual References Separate**
Create image folders/boards for visual inspiration (Pinterest, etc.)

### **5. Back Up Everything**
Digital: Cloud storage + local backup
Physical: Photo backup of important pages

### **6. Share with Beta Readers**
Some might fact-check or notice issues—share relevant research sections.

---

## 🎨 **Visual Organization**

### **Inspiration Boards:**

**Pinterest:**
- Create secret boards
- Organize by topic
- Visual setting references
- Costume and props
- Architecture and locations

**Physical Bulletin Board:**
- Print key images
- Post timeline
- Character photos
- Setting inspiration
- Maps
