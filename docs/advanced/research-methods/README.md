## 🚀 **Quick Start Guide**

### **For Pantsers (Discovery Writers):**

1. **Start writing** with what you know
2. **Mark gaps** as you write (use [RESEARCH] tags)
3. **Research between drafts** to fill in details
4. **Revise** with newfound accuracy

### **For Plotters (Planners):**

1. **Identify key knowledge gaps** during outlining
2. **Research major elements** before drafting
3. **Keep a running list** of minor details to check
4. **Verify specifics** during revision

### **For Everyone:**

✅ Research **core elements** that drive your plot  
✅ Fact-check **specialized knowledge** (legal, medical, technical)  
✅ Verify **time period details** for historical settings  
✅ Experience **locations and activities** when possible  
❌ Don't research **every tiny detail** before starting  
❌ Don't let research **delay your writing indefinitely**

## 💡 **Research Principles**

### **1. Story First**
Research serves your narrative—not the other way around. Know enough to write confidently, then keep moving forward.

### **2. Specific Over General**
One precise, researched detail is worth ten vague generalities.

**Generic:**
> "The surgery was complicated."

**Researched:**
> "The surgeon's hands moved in practiced rhythm—clamp, suture, cauterize—while the monitor beeped steadily at 72 BPM."

### **3. Authority Through Restraint**
Readers sense when you know more than you're telling. Use research like an iceberg—show 10%, let the other 90% support what's visible.

### **4. Experience When Possible**
First-hand experience trumps reading about something. Taste that food, visit that location, try that activity.

### **5. Multiple Sources**
Cross-reference information. One source might be outdated, biased, or simply wrong.

## 🎯 **Common Research Mistakes**

### **❌ The Research Trap**

**Problem:** Endless researching, never writing

**Solution:**
- Set research time limits
- Use [RESEARCH] placeholders in drafts
- Remember: you're writing fiction, not a dissertation
- Trust that you can fact-check later

---

### **❌ The Info-Dump**

**Problem:** Showing off research by including everything learned

**Solution:**
- Only include what the POV character would notice
- Let research inform your writing without dominating it
- Cut any paragraph that feels like a lecture
- Ask: "Does this serve the story or just show I researched?"

---

### **❌ The Wikipedia-Only Research**

**Problem:** Relying solely on surface-level sources

**Solution:**
- Consult primary sources when possible
- Read books, not just articles
- Talk to real experts
- Experience things firsthand

---

### **❌ The Frozen-in-Research Mode**

**Problem:** Afraid to write without perfect knowledge

**Solution:**
- Accept that you'll get some things wrong
- Revision exists for a reason
- Your first draft doesn't need to be perfect
- Beta readers can catch inaccuracies

## 📊 **Research Depth by Story Element**

| Element | Research Depth | Why |

| **Setting/Location** | MODERATE-DEEP | Creates immersion |
| **Character Profession** | MODERATE | Needs authenticity |
| **Background Details** | LIGHT | Needs plausibility |

## 💭 **The Balance**

The art of research is knowing **when to stop**:

> "Research is like fertilizer. A little makes things grow. Too much kills everything."

Your goal isn't to become an expert—it's to write with **enough authority** that your story feels real, and **enough freedom** that your imagination can soar.
