# 🌐 Research Ethics

> *Responsible research practices for fiction writers*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

With research comes responsibility. As writers, we have ethical obligations:
- To the **people** we research and portray
- To the **cultures** we represent
- To our **readers** who trust our portrayal
- To the **truth**, even in fiction

This guide covers ethical considerations when researching and writing about real people, places, cultures, and sensitive topics.

## 🤝 **Respecting Your Sources**

### **Expert Interviews**

**Ethical Practices:**

✅ **Be Honest About Your Project**
- Explain it's for fiction
- Describe the genre and subject matter
- Be upfront about how you'll use information

✅ **Respect Their Time**
- Come prepared with questions
- Stay within agreed time limit
- Don't contact repeatedly without permission

✅ **Offer Anonymity If Appropriate**
- Some people can't/shouldn't be named
- Professionals may face workplace issues
- Offer to change identifying details

✅ **Give Credit When Appropriate**
- Acknowledgments section
- Author's note
- Dedication (if significant contribution)

✅ **Share the Finished Work**
- Send them a copy if they want one
- Thank them again
- Consider asking for feedback (but don't obligate them)

---

**Unethical Practices:**

❌ Misrepresenting why you need information
❌ Promising anonymity then identifying them
❌ Pestering after they've declined
❌ Using personal information they shared off-record
❌ Presenting their expertise as your own invention
❌ Ignoring their advice/corrections without good reason

---

### **Personal Stories and Experiences**

**When Someone Shares Their Story:**

**Consider:**
- Did they give permission for you to use it?
- Could they be identified, even indirectly?
- Would publication cause them harm or embarrassment?
- Is their story yours to tell?

**Best Practice:**
> Get **explicit permission** before using someone's personal experience, even if changed/fictionalized.

**Example:**
> "A friend told me about her experience with X. Can I use that as inspiration for a character, with details changed?" 

If they say yes: Get it in writing (even just an email).
If they say no: Respect it completely.
If you're unsure: Ask clearly.

## 🌍 **Cultural Sensitivity and Representation**

### **Writing Outside Your Culture**

**First Question: Should I?**

Before writing characters from cultures/identities different from your own, honestly ask:
- Why am I telling this story?
- Am I the right person to tell it?
- Could someone from that culture tell it better?
- Am I taking space from marginalized voices?
- What are my motivations?

**Not automatically a "no"** — but requires **deep thought and extra care**.

---

### **If You Proceed:**

**Required Steps:**

✅ **Deep Research**
- Not just Wikipedia
- Multiple sources
- Primary sources when possible
- Contemporary voices from that culture
- Historical and modern perspectives

✅ **Sensitivity Readers**
- **Essential**, not optional
- Hire readers from the culture/identity you're writing
- Pay them fairly (going rate: $0.01-0.03/word or $250+ per manuscript)
- Listen to their feedback
- Be willing to make changes

✅ **Avoid Stereotypes**
- Research common stereotypes—then avoid them
- Show diversity within the culture
- Avoid making culture the character's only trait
- Show individual complexity

✅ **Understand Nuance**
- Cultures aren't monolithic
- Individual experience varies
- Historical vs. contemporary differences
- Regional variations

✅ **Consider Power Dynamics**
- Who has historically told stories about this culture?
- What harm have inaccurate portrayals caused?
- How can you avoid perpetuating harm?

---

### **Red Flags of Appropriation:**

⚠️ **Taking without understanding**
- Using sacred/closed cultural practices as aesthetic
- Treating culture as costume or exotic backdrop
- Cherry-picking "cool" elements while ignoring context

⚠️ **Profiting from marginalized stories**
- Especially if own-voices authors struggle for recognition
- Taking publishing opportunities from marginalized writers

⚠️ **Perpetuating harmful stereotypes**
- Even with good intentions
- "Positive" stereotypes are still stereotypes
- Reinforcing problematic tropes

⚠️ **Trauma tourism**
- Exploiting others' trauma for dramatic effect
- Not giving dignity to real suffering
- Using tragedy as plot device

---

### **Cultural Research Ethics:**

**Do:**
- ✅ Read widely, including authors from that culture
- ✅ Engage with contemporary voices
- ✅ Learn about cultural context and history
- ✅ Understand current issues facing that community
- ✅ Hire sensitivity readers
- ✅ Acknowledge cultural consultants
- ✅ Listen to criticism with openness
- ✅ Be willing to revise or even scrap work

**Don't:**
- ❌ Rely solely on outsider perspectives
- ❌ Use culture as exotic backdrop
- ❌ Make culture synonymous with conflict/tragedy
- ❌ Treat culture as monolithic
- ❌ Ignore sensitivity reader feedback
- ❌ Get defensive about criticism
- ❌ Speak over people from that culture

---

## 🏥 **Sensitive Topics**

### **Mental Illness and Disability**

**Ethical Considerations:**

**Avoid:**
- ❌ Mental illness as villain motivation only
- ❌ Disability existing only to inspire others ("inspiration porn")
- ❌ Magical cure narratives
- ❌ Outdated/offensive terminology
- ❌ Conflating different conditions
- ❌ Making trauma "beautiful" or "romantic"

**Do:**
- ✅ Research the actual experience
- ✅ Show diverse experiences (not everyone with X condition experiences it the same)
- ✅ Include disability without making it the entire character
- ✅ Consult sensitivity readers with lived experience
- ✅ Portray accommodation and adaptation
- ✅ Recognize disabled people as full humans

**Resources:**
- Disability advocates and writers
- Medical professionals AND people with lived experience
- Organizations led by disabled people
- Contemporary writing about disability

---

### **Trauma and Violence**

**Ethical Considerations:**

**Sexual Violence:**
- Is it necessary to the story?
- Are you handling it with appropriate gravity?
- Are you avoiding gratuitous detail?
- Does it serve the story or just shock value?
- Are you considering survivor readers?

**Child Abuse:**
- Extra care required
- Consider: does it need to be on-page?
- Focus on aftermath and resilience, not graphic details
- Consult trauma experts if central to plot

**Hate Crimes and Historical Atrocities:**
- Research thoroughly and respectfully
- Avoid sensationalizing
- Consider descendants of victims
- Show dignity even in depicting horror
- Understand historical context fully

**General Guidelines:**
- Focus on impact rather than graphic detail
- Consider reader triggers (content warnings)
- Avoid using trauma as character development shortcut
- Show realistic aftermath and recovery (or lack thereof)
- Consult trauma survivors and experts

---

### **Suicide and Self-Harm**

**Critical Considerations:**

**Research Guidelines:**
- Avoid detailed descriptions of methods
- Don't romanticize or glorify
- Show realistic consequences
- Include resources in author's note if topic is central
- Consider contagion effect

**Responsible Portrayal:**
- Mental illness is complex (not just sadness)
- Suicide is not romantic or noble
- Show impact on others
- Avoid "successful suicide solves problems" narratives
- If showing recovery, make it realistic

---

## 👥 **Real People in Fiction**

### **Public Figures**

**Legal Issues:**
- Defamation laws vary by country
- Public figures have less protection than private citizens
- Truth is a defense, but can still cause legal issues

**Ethical Issues:**
- Even if legal, is it right?
- Would this harm their reputation unfairly?
- Are you perpetuating false narratives?
- What about their family?

**Best Practice:**
- Fictionalize significantly
- Use composites rather than individuals
- Change names and identifying details
- Consider: is using real person necessary?

---

### **Historical Figures**

**More Freedom, but Still:**
- Research thoroughly
- Represent fairly (even villains had complexity)
- Acknowledge gaps in historical record
- Don't impose modern values unfairly
- Consider descendants

---

### **Private Individuals**

**Essential:**
- Get **written permission**
- Change identifying details significantly
- Consider impact on their life
- Respect their "no" completely
- Never expose private information without consent

---

## 📚 **Academic and Professional Ethics**

### **Using Others' Research**

**Proper Attribution:**
- Don't present others' theories as your own
- Acknowledge sources in author's note
- If heavily based on one source, credit it prominently
- Respect copyright on quoted material

**Fair Use (Generally):**
- Brief quotes for commentary/criticism
- Transformative use
- Not substituting for original
- Varies by country—check local laws

**When in Doubt:**
- Credit your sources
- Ask permission for substantial quotes
- Hire lawyers for complex situations

---

### **Plagiarism in Research**

**Even in Fiction:**
- Don't copy non-fiction sources directly into prose
- Paraphrase and transform
- Ideas can be used; exact language should not be stolen
- Credit unusual or unique theories/ideas

---

## ⚖️ **When Ethics and Story Conflict**

### **The Hard Questions:**

Sometimes ethical storytelling conflicts with dramatic storytelling. When that happens:

**Options:**
1. **Revise the story** — Find another way to achieve your goal
2. **Increase research depth** — Better understanding might reveal ethical path
3. **Get expert input** — Sensitivity readers, cultural consultants
4. **Consider if you're the right person** to tell this story
5. **Accept limitations** — Some stories might not be yours to tell

**Remember:**
> Your creative freedom doesn't override your ethical responsibility.
