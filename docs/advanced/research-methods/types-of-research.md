## 🎭 **Experiential Research**

### **What It Is:**

Actually **doing** what your characters do—experiencing it firsthand.

### **Types:**

#### **1. Physical Activities**

Try the sport, hobby, or skill your character performs.

**Examples:**
- Learning to fence for a swashbuckling adventure
- Taking a pottery class for an artist character
- Rock climbing for a mountain rescue thriller
- Cooking lessons for a chef protagonist

**Benefits:**
- Feel the physical sensations
- Understand the learning curve
- Discover unexpected difficulties
- Gain authentic terminology

---

#### **2. Location Visits**

Go to the places where your story unfolds.

**What to Do:**
- 📸 Take photos (lighting, architecture, details)
- 📝 Take notes (sounds, smells, atmosphere)
- 🚶 Walk routes your characters take
- ⏰ Visit at different times of day
- 🗣️ Talk to locals
- 🍽️ Eat local food
- 🛍️ Browse local shops

**What You'll Gain:**
> "I thought the harbor would smell like fish. It actually smells like diesel, brine, and rust—completely different sensory palette."

---

#### **3. Job Shadowing**

Spend time observing professionals in their work environment.

**Best Practices:**
- Be respectful of their time
- Come prepared with questions
- Observe without interfering
- Ask about unexpected aspects
- Note the small details (routines, jargon, frustrations)

**Example:**
> Shadowing an ER doctor reveals:
> - The constant interruptions
> - The smell of antiseptic mixed with everything else
> - How doctors actually communicate (shorthand, dark humor)
> - The noise level and chaos
> - What they eat, when they eat, bathroom breaks

---

#### **4. Immersive Experiences**

Temporarily adopt aspects of your character's life.

**Examples:**
- Sleeping in a tent for a week (survival story)
- Fasting for religious research
- Living on a strict budget (poverty narrative)
- Using public transit exclusively (character without car)

**Important:** 
⚠️ Be ethical—don't fake disabilities or misrepresent yourself. Some experiences aren't appropriate to simulate.

## 💡 **Pro Tips**

### **1. Start Broad, Then Narrow**
Begin with general overview sources, then drill into specifics.

### **2. Cross-Reference Everything**
