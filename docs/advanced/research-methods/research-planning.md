# 📅 Research Planning

> *Strategic approaches to research—knowing when, what, and how much*

---

## 📖 **Overview**

Good research planning prevents two common pitfalls:
1. **Research paralysis:** Getting stuck researching forever
2. **Research gaps:** Writing yourself into corners with missing knowledge

The key is finding the balance between **enough knowledge to write confidently** and **enough momentum to actually write**.

---

## ⏰ **When to Research**

### **Before Writing (Upfront Research)**

**Best For:**
- Historical settings (need time period basics)
- Technical/specialized fields (medical, legal, military)
- Unfamiliar locations (major geography and culture)
- Plot-critical details (the story hinges on accuracy)

**What to Research:**
- ✅ Core facts that affect plot structure
- ✅ Time period basics and major events
- ✅ Setting geography and climate
- ✅ Major cultural or social norms
- ✅ Technical processes central to plot
- ✅ Character profession fundamentals

**What to Skip:**
- ❌ Every tiny detail
- ❌ Tangential background information
- ❌ Atmospheric details (get these during writing)
- ❌ Minor character specializations
- ❌ Specific dialogue phrasing

**Time Limit:**
Set a deadline. Example: "Two weeks of research, then I start drafting."

---

### **During Writing (Just-in-Time Research)**

**Best For:**
- Discovery writers (pantsers)
- Maintaining writing momentum
- Unexpected plot developments
- Character voice development

**Method:**

1. **Mark as you go:**
   ```
   She walked into the [RESEARCH: typical 1950s diner layout] 
   and ordered [RESEARCH: popular menu items era].
   ```

2. **Keep writing** past the gap

3. **Quick check** only if it affects immediate plot
   - Use 5-minute rule: If you can't find it in 5 minutes, mark it and move on

4. **Research in batches** during natural breaks
   - End of writing session
   - Between chapters
   - During planned rest days

**Advantages:**
- ✅ Maintains momentum
- ✅ Research only what you actually need
- ✅ Stays focused on story
- ✅ Less procrastination temptation

---

### **Between Drafts (Batch Research)**

**Best For:**
- Filling in marked gaps
- Deepening existing scenes
- Fact-checking completed draft
- Adding authentic details

**Process:**

1. **Compile** all [RESEARCH] tags from draft
2. **Categorize** by topic/type
3. **Prioritize** (plot-critical first)
4. **Batch** similar research tasks
5. **Set time limits** for each category
6. **Apply** findings to revision

**Example Research List:**
```
HIGH PRIORITY:
- [ ] How does a submarine emergency surface work? (Ch. 15)
- [ ] Can DNA tests be rushed? How long? (Ch. 22)
- [ ] Victorian mourning customs for widow (Ch. 3, 8, 19)

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
- [ ] Typical 1920s women's day wear (Ch. 2)
- [ ] Paris Metro stations near Montmartre (Ch. 12)
- [ ] What could doctor diagnose without X-ray? (Ch. 7)

LOW PRIORITY:
- [ ] French breakfast foods (Ch. 1)
- [ ] Common first names 1890s England (various)
- [ ] Garden flowers in July, London (Ch. 9)
```

---

### **During Revision (Verification Research)**

**Best For:**
- Fact-checking specific claims
- Catching anachronisms
- Verifying technical accuracy
- Adding sensory details

**What to Check:**
- ✅ Dates and timelines
- ✅ Technical processes
- ✅ Historical facts
- ✅ Geography and travel times

## 📊 **The Research Depth Matrix**

| Element | Minimal Research | Moderate Research | Deep Research |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| **Time investment** | Hours | Days | Weeks |
| **Source types** | Wikipedia, Google | Books, articles, videos | Archives, experts, primary sources |
| **Detail level** | General plausibility | Specific accuracy | Expert-level knowledge |
| **Use case** | Background elements | Supporting details | Core plot elements |

### **Example Applications:**

**Minimal:** Your protagonist walks past a construction site (not relevant to plot)
- Quick Google: What equipment is used? What sounds?
- Good enough: "Jackhammers, crane, workers in hard hats"

**Moderate:** Your protagonist's sister is a pediatric nurse
- Read articles about pediatric nursing
- Watch YouTube day-in-the-life videos
- Note key details for authentic references

**Deep:** Your protagonist IS a pediatric nurse solving a medical mystery
- Interview actual pediatric nurses
- Read nursing textbooks
- Shadow at a hospital if possible
- Join nursing forums
- Understand terminology, procedures, culture

## 🗺️ **Creating a Research Plan**

### **Step 1: Identify Knowledge Gaps**

**Brainstorm:**
- What do I need to know to write this story?
- What could readers with expertise catch me on?
- What feels fuzzy or uncertain in my outline?
- What would my character need to know?

**Categorize Gaps:**
```
MUST KNOW (Can't write without it):
- Time period: Social norms, technology, daily life
- Setting: Geography, climate, culture
- Plot device: How the core mechanism works

SHOULD KNOW (Affects credibility):
- Character profession: Terminology, daily routines
- Specialized skills: Accurate process details
- Cultural context: Customs, beliefs, conflicts

NICE TO KNOW (Enriches story):
- Period details: Fashion, food, entertainment
- Local flavor: Dialect, landmarks, traditions
- Background texture: Historical events, famous figures
```

---

### **Step 2: Set Research Parameters**

## 🚫 **Avoiding Research Rabbit Holes**

### **Warning Signs You're in a Rabbit Hole:**

- ⚠️ You've been researching the same topic for days
- ⚠️ You're researching details completely tangential to your story
- ⚠️ You're reading your 47th article "just to be sure"
- ⚠️ You're afraid to start writing until you know "everything"
- ⚠️ Research feels like procrastination (be honest!)
- ⚠️ You've forgotten what you originally needed to know

### **Escape Strategies:**

**1. Set Timer**
"I'll research this topic for 1 hour, then stop whether I'm done or not."

**2. Question Test**
Write down your specific question. When you can answer it, stop.

**3. Good Enough Threshold**
"Do I know enough to write this scene? Yes? Then stop researching."

**4. Source Limit**
"I'll consult 3 sources max, then move on."

**5. Accountability**
Tell someone your research deadline and writing start date.

**6. Remember Your Goal**
"I'm writing a novel, not a dissertation."
